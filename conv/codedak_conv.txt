not the hacking and gagging and spitting part  please	okay then how bout we try out some french cuisine  saturday  night
no no its my fault  we didnt have a proper introduction 	cameron
the thing is cameron  im at the mercy of a particularly hideous breed of loser  my sister  i cant date until she does	seems like she could get a date easy enough
why	unsolved mystery  she used to be really popular when she started high school then it was just like she got sick of it or something
gosh if only we could find kat a boyfriend	let me see what i can do
cesc ma tete this is my head	right  see  youre ready for the quiz
how is our little find the wench a date plan progressing	well theres someone i think might be 
there	where
you got something on your mind	i counted on you to help my cause you and that thug are obviously failing arent we ever going on our date
you have my word  as a gentleman	youre sweet
how do you get your hair to look like that	ebers deep conditioner every two days and i never ever use a blowdryer without the diffuser attachment
sure have	i really really really wanna go but i cant  not unless my sister goes
so thats the kind of guy she likes pretty ones	who knows  all ive ever heard her say is that shed dip before dating a guy that smokes
hi	looks like things worked out tonight huh
have fun tonight	tons
i looked for you back at the party but you always seemed to be occupied	i was
well no	then thats all you had to say
me  this endless blonde babble im like boring myself	thank god  if i had to hear one more story about your coiffure

im kidding  you know how sometimes you just become this persona  and you dont know how to quit	no
wow	lets go
she okay	i hope so
they do to	they do not
did you change your hair	no
where did he go  he was just here	who
great	would you mind getting me a drink cameron
he practically proposed when he found out we had the same dermatologist i mean dr bonchowski is great an all but hes not exactly relevant party conversation	is he oily or dry
bianca i dont think the highlights of dating joey dorsey are going to include dooropening and coatholding	sometimes i wonder if the guys were supposed to want to go out with are the ones we actually want to go out with you know
i have to be home in twenty minutes	i dont have to be home til two
so yeah ive got the sears catalog thing going  and the tube sock gig  thats gonna be huge  and then im up for an ad for queen harry next week	queen harry
neat	my agent says ive got a good shot at being the prada guy next year
listen i want to talk to you about the prom	you know the deal  i can  t go if kat doesnt go 
i have the potential to smack the crap out of you if you dont get out of my way	can you at least start wearing a bra
oh my god does this mean youre becoming normal	it means that gigglepuss is playing at club skunk and were going
oh i thought you might have a date  i dont know why im bothering to ask but are you going to bogey lowensteins party saturday night	what do you think
youre ruining my life  because you wont be normal i cant be normal	whats normal
cant you forget for just one night that youre completely wretched	at least im not a clouted fen sucked hedgepig
you are so completely unbalanced	can we go now
bianca i need to talk to you  i need to tell you 	i really dont think i need any social advice from you right now
i dont get you  you act like youre too good for any of this and then you go totally apeshit when you get here	youre welcome
i do care but im a firm believer in doing something for your own reasons not someone else  s 	i wish i had that luxury im the only sophomore that got asked to the prom and i cant go because you won  t
joey never told you we went out did he	what
in 9th  for a month	why
he was like a total babe	but you hate joey
now i do  back then was a different story	as in
he said everyone was doing it  so i did it	you did what
why didnt you tell me	i wanted to let you make up your own mind about him
thats not	im not stupid enough to repeat your mistakes
i guess i thought i was protecting you	god youre just like him just keep me locked away in the dark so i cant experience anything for myself
you looked beautiful last night you know	so did you
what if she never starts dating	then neither will you  and ill get to sleep at night
but she doesnt want to date	exactly my point
daddy i 	and wherere you going
if you must know we were attempting to go to a small study group of friends	otherwise known as an orgy
daddy people expect me to be there	if kats not going youre not going
oh god  its starting	its just a party daddy
wear the belly before you go	daddy no
promise me you wont talk to any boys unless your sister is present	why
daddy i want to discuss the prom with you its tomorrow night 	the prom  kat has a date
no but	its that hot rod joey right that  s who you want me to bend my rules for
hes not a hot rod  whatever that is	youre not going unless your sister goes  end of story
im missing something	i have a date daddy  and he  s not a captain of oppression like some men we know
fan of a fan  you see a couple of minors come in	never
so  which dakota you from	north actually  howd you   
i was kidding people actually live there	yeah  a couple  were outnumbered by the cows though
how many people were in your old school	thirtytwo
that im used to	yeah but these guys have never seen a horse  they just jack off to clint eastwood
that girl  i 	you burn you pine you perish
who is she	bianca stratford  sophomore dont even think about it
why not	i could start with your haircut but it doesnt matter  shes not allowed to date until her older sister does  and thats an impossibility
why do girls like that always like guys like that	because theyre bred to  their mothers liked guys like that and their grandmothers before them their gene pool is rarely diluted
he always have that shiteating grin	joey dorsey  permashitgrin  i wish i could say hes a moron but hes number twelve in the class  and a model  mostly regional stuff but hes rumored to have a big tube sock ad coming out
you know french	sure do  my moms from canada
yeah just a minor encounter with the shrew	thats her  biancas sister
i teach her french get to know her dazzle her with charm and she falls in love with me	unlikely but even so she still cant go out with you  so whats the point
what about him	you wanna go out with him
what makes you think hell do it	he seems like he thrives on danger
no kidding  hes a criminal  i heard he lit a state trooper on fire  he just got out of alcatraz	they always let felons sit in on honors biology
you know if you do go out with bianca youd be set  youd outrank everyone strictly alist  with me by your side	i thought you hated those people
you got him involved	like we had a choice  besides  when you let the enemy think hes orchestrating the battle youre in a position of power we let him pretend hes calling the shots and while hes busy setting up the plan you have time to woo bianca
this is it  a golden opportunity patrick can ask katarina to the party	in that case well need to make it a schoolwide blow out
will bogey get bent	are you kidding  hell piss himself with joy  hes the ultimate kiss ass
number one  she hates smokers	its a lung cancer issue
her favorite uncle	dead at fortyone
hes pretty	okay  i wasnt sure
assail your ears for one night	its her favorite band
you told me that part already	hell ive just been going over the whole thing in my head and 
extremely unfortunate maneuver	the hell is that  what kind of guy just picks up a girl and carries her away while youre talking to her
buttholus extremus  but hey youre making progress	no i  m not
you humiliated the woman sacrifice yourself on the altar of dignity and even the score	best case scenario youre back on the payroll for awhile
and he means that strictly in a non prisonmovie type of way	yeah  well see
whatve you got for me	ive retrieved certain pieces of information on miss katarina stratford i think youll find helpful
okay  likes  thai food feminist prose and angry stinky girl music of the indierock persuasion	so what does that give me  im supposed to buy her some noodles and a book and sit around listening to chicks who cant play their instruments
gigglepuss is playing there tomorrow night	dont make me do it man
what re you talking about	shes partial to joey not me
cameron  do you like the girl	sure

hey  do you mind	not at all
where ya goin	away
leave my sister alone	and why would i do that
yeah	what do you think
two legs nice rack	yeah whatever  i want you to go out with her
you got it verona  i pick up the tab you do the honors	youre gonna pay me to take out some girl
i cant date her sister until that one gets a boyfriend  and thats the catch she doesnt want a boyfriend	how much
when i shell out fifty i expect results	im on it
watching the bitch trash my car doesnt count as a date	i got her under control she just acts crazed in public to keep up the image
i just upped my price	what
a hundred bucks a date	forget it
its about time	a deals a deal
howd you do it	do what
hey	are you lost
nope  just came by to chat	we dont chat
but she cant go out with you because her sister is this insane head case and no one will go out with her right	does this conversation have a purpose
i hear youre helpin verona	uh  yeah  were old friend
you and verona	what  we took bathes together when we were kids
you better not fuck this up  im heavily invested	hey  its all for the higher good right

he always look so	block e
mandella eat  starving yourself is a very slow way to die	just a little
whats this	an attempted slit
i realize that the men of this fine institution are severely lacking but killing yourself so you can be with william shakespeare is beyond the scope of normal teenage obsessions  youre venturing far past daytime talk show fodder and entering the world of those who need very expensive therapy	but imagine the things hed say during sex
the people at this school are so incredibly foul	you could always go with me  im sure william has some friends
so he has this huge raging fit about sarah lawrence and insists that i go to his maledominated puking frat boy number one golf team school i have no say at all	william would never have gone to a state school
william didnt even go to high school	thats never been proven
i appreciate your efforts toward a speedy death but im consuming  do you mind	does it matter
you think thisll work	no fear
whatd he say	who cares
you went to the party  i thought we were officially opposed to suburban social activity	i didnt have a choice
you didnt have a choice  wheres kat and what have you done with her	i did bianca a favor and it backfired
you didnt	i got drunk  i puked  i got rejected it was big fun
can you even imagine  who the hell would go to this a bastion of commercial excess	well i guess were not since we dont have dates 
listen to you  you sound like betty all pissed off because archie is taking veronica	okay okay we wont go  its not like i have a dress anyway
you  re looking at this from the wrong perspective  were making a statement	oh good  something new and different for us
have you seen him	who
william  he asked me to meet him here	oh honey  tell me we havent progressed to fullon hallucinations
i mean woman  how ya doin	sweating like a pig actually  and yourself
theres a way to get a guys attention	my mission in life

katarina stratford  my my  youve been terrorizing ms blaise again	expressing my opinion is not a terrorist action

the super said hed seen her before but she didnt live here	pretty
hmmmm	maybe you dont care about that either  prettiest suspect ive had in awhile
maybe its a ritual thing or someone trying to send a message  burial rites are taken very seriously in eastern europe  it could be to humiliate them just burning them up no proper funeral its like condemning them to hell	eastern europe  like what  romania hungary
ill come with you	there wasnt a fire  therell be nothing for you to do
i can watch you eddie  maybe ill learn something	this isnt homicide school

you thirsty	im on duty
hey  i always wanted to be a cop when i was a kid  i dreamed of running up to a door kicking it in pulling my gun and yelling freeze at the bad guy whatd you dream about	i wanted to run up to a building on fire kick in the door rush into the smoke and save a kid
what are you hiding  why are you afraid	she just saw two of her friends killed they probably threatened her
why not	something back home
shes fucked  even if that story is true	raw deal
look  let me talk to her  any leads i get theyre all yours  just let me have a first crack at her	you wanna talk to her alone
yeah	what would your girlfriend think of that

i told you you know i thought i was doing the right thing you know i think shes innocent	well its not up to you to decide whether shes innocent or not  dont you understand thats why youre a professional
but i mean didnt you ever go out on a limb for somebody  i mean you shoulda heard her there  tellin her whole storyi believed her	how you go out on a limb for somebody is by giving her a number of an immigration lawyer  here heres a number of an immigration lawyer  thats how you help her but you cant get involved in her like that  youre gonna jeopardize your career your life and youre gonna jeopardize my case  and lemme give you another piece of advice  maybe you dont watch tv but ill let you in on a little secret  the whole fuckin world watches television  and when you get out there they know your face  and the little fame the little fuckin itty bitty fame that i get in this city makes it a lot easier for my job  and i get more done because of it

no  we are insane  who else but crazy men would film their murders  so we kill someone famous and if we are caught we are sent to mental hospital but what good is money there  because once in hospital i say i not crazy just pretended to be acquitted  we see psychiatrists  they must certify we are sane and because of your  what is law called  oh  i got it  because of your double jeopardy law we cant be tried for same crime twice  we come out free rich and famous	good idea

im seriousthis  this is a great american film  full of violence and sex  and i want my credit	credit
yes  before we hand in the next video  i put titles on it and my credit is going to read  directed by oleg razgul	yes  but theres only one problem  you want credit but the problem is  i dont share credit

take the car  get outta here tommy	look you cant shoot him in cold blood
this had nothing to do with shoes that didnt fit or my relationship with my father who as you know made a fortune selling penny loafers in the fifties these people died because of the criminal actions of my doctor	your doctor
yes  my psychiatrist didnt insist that i stay on my medication	so you feel absolutely no responsibility for killing these people
look im a victim here too  i was a year away from getting my masters in art now ill never graduate  my life has been permanently disrupted	permanently disrupted  arent you selling paintings now for quite a lot of money  hasnt this incident as you call it jump started your career as an artist
were in negotiations thats correct	but doesnt the son of sam law prevent criminals from profiting from their crimes
space stattion 5  lounge	well how nice to see you again elena youre looking wonderful
continued	im afraid ive only got a few minutes but id love to
continued	shes wonderful
continued	well i suppose theyve been having a bit of trouble with some of the equipment
continued	how did they manage to do that without any communication
continued	im sorry dr smyslov but im really not at liberty to discuss this
continued	were trying to get there i hope we can
hi frank coming in please	right just a sec
dave if youve a minute id like your advice on something	sure what is it
well its nothing really important but its annoying	whats up
its about my salary cheques	yes
thats right well naturally i didnt say anything to payroll i assumed theyd start paying me at the higher grade on the next pay cheque but its been almost three weeks now and im still being paid as an ags18	interesting that you mention it because ive got the same problem
really	yes
well what do you think we ought to do about it	i dont think we should make any fuss about it yet im sure theyll straighten it out
i must say i never did understand why they split us into two groups for training	no i never did either
i suppose the idea was specialized training	i suppose so though of course theres a more sinister explanation
oh	yes you must have heard the rumour that went around during orbital checkout
no as a matter of fact i didnt	oh well apparently theres something about the mission that the sleeping beauties know that we dont know and thats why we were trained separately and thats why they were put to sleep before they were even taken aboard
yes i thought so	of course it would be very easy for us to find out now
how	just ask hal its conceivable they might keep something from us but theyd never keep anything from hal
not really though it is strange when you think about it it didnt really make any sense to keep us apart during training	yes but its to fantastic to think that theyd keep something from us
i know it would be almost inconceivable	but not completely inconceivable
well thats something	yes i dont know what to make of it
good morning hows it going	are you reasonably awake
oh im fine im wide awake whats up	well hals reported the aounit about to fail again
youre kidding	no
i dont know hal said he thought it might be the assembly procedure	two units in four days how many spares do we have
two more	well i hope theres nothing wrong with the assembly on those other wise were out of business
its the last one	well now that weve got one thats actually failed we should be able to figure out whats happened and fix it
i didnt do that frank i took particular care not to freeze them	i guess you dont know your own strength old boy
i guess not	i think ill have to go out and burn them off
im sorry frank but i dont think i can answer that question without knowing everything that all of you know	hes got a point
sorry to interrupt the festivities dave but i think weve got a problem	what is it hal
the unit is still operational dave but it will fail within seventytwo hours	i understand hal well take care of it please let me have the hard copy
not now hal id like to talk to you about something	sure dave whats up
you know that we checked the two aounits that you reported in imminent failure condition	yes i know
im not questioning your word dave but its just not possible im not capable of being wrong	hal is there anything bothering you  anything that might account for this problem
look dave i know that youre sincere and that youre trying to do a competent job and that youre trying to be helpful but i can assure the problem is with the aounits and with your test gear	okay hal well lets see the way things go from here on
naturally dave im not pleased that the aounit has failed but i hope at least this has restored your confidence in my integrity and reliability i certainly wouldnt want to be disconnected even temporarily as i have never been disconnected in my entire service history	im sorry about the misunderstanding hal
well dont worry about it	and dont you worry about it
too bad about frank isnt it	yes it is
i suppose its because youve been under a lot of stress but have you forgotten that theyre not supposed to be revived for another three months	the antenna has to be replaced
look dave yourve probably got a lot to do i suggest you leave it to me	hal switch to manual hibernation control
i can tell from the tone of your voice dave that youre upset why dont you take a stress pill and get some rest	hal im in command of this ship i order you to release the manual hibernation control
im sorry dave but in accordance with subroutine c15324 quote when the crew are dead or incapacitated the computer must assume control unquote i must therefore override your authority now since you are not in any condition to intel ligently exercise it	hal unless you follow my instructions i shall be forced to disconnect you
i am prepared to do that anyway	i know that youve had that on your mind for some time now dave but it would be a crying shame since i am so much more capable of carrying out this mission than you are and i have such enthusiasm and confi dence in the mission
continued	yes i remember you mentioning it i got mine about the same time
continued	well what is it
coninued	well its silly but if you want to why dont you
continued	still you really dont believe it do you
im at space station five darling how are you	im fine daddy when are you coming home
im having a party tomorrow	yes i know that sweetheart
are you coming to my party	no im sorry darling i told you i wont be home for a few days
one two three can i speak to mommy	mommys out to the hair dresser
where is mrs brown	shes in the bathroom
okay sweetheart well i have to go now tell mommy that i called	how many days until you come home
ill wish you a happy birthday now and ill see you soon all right darling	yes daddy
bye bye now sweetheart	goodbye daddy
oh thank you very much	thank you
well ive heard more and more people talk of an epidemic	i suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later
berkeley told me that they think it came from contamination on a returning mars flight	yes well whatever it is theyre certainly not fooling around this is the first flight they allowed in for more than a week
i was working out what this trip must cost taking him up there by himself and coming back empty	ill bet its a fortune
oh thats such a delightful age	how is gregor
clavius control came on the air just long enough to transmit their refusal	well that does sound very odd
well gregor and i will look forward to seeing you	thank you its been a great pleasure to meet all of you dr smyslov
how do you do mr miller	im terribly sorry i was just on my way down to meet you i saw your ship dock and i knew i had plenty of time and i was on my way out of the office when suddenly the phone rang
well thank you very much for being so understanding	please it really doesnt matter
well did you have a pleaant flight	yes very pleasant
well shall we go through documentation	fine
yes i think so just about then	i suppose you saw the work on our new section while you were docking
oh i really dont have time for a drink if its all right ill just sit for a minute and then ive got to be off	are you quite sure
well as it happens im on my way up to the moon	are you by any chance going up to your base at clavius
im sorry but im not sure i know what you mean	well its just for the past two weeks there have been some extremely odd things happening at clavius
really	yes well for one thing whenever you phone the base all you can get is a recording which repeats that the phone lines are temporarily out of order
yes well at first we thought that was the explanation but its been going on for the past ten days	you mean you havent been able to get anyone at the base for ten days
thats right	i see
yes and im afaid theres going to be a bit of a row about it denying the men permission to land was a direct violation of the ias convention	yes well i hope the crew got back safely
fortunately they did	well im glad about that
dr floyd at the risk of pressing you on a point you seem reticent to discuss may i ask you a straightforward question	certainly
dr floyd how long do you think this can be kept under wraps	im afraid it can and it will be kept under wraps as long as it is deemed to be necessary by the council and of course you know that the council has requested that formal security oaths are to be obtained in writing from every one who had any knowledge of this event there must be adequate time for a full study to be made of the situation before any con sideration can be given to making a public announcement
yes it does the subsurface structure shows that it was deliberately buried about four million years ago	how can you tell it was deliberately buried
by the deformation between the mother rock and the fill	any clue as to what it is
but you dont have any idea as to what it is	tomb shine surveymarker spare part take your choice
any ideas about the colour	well not really at first glance black would suggest something sunpowered but then why would anyone deliberately bury a sun powered device
has it been exposed to any sun before now	i dont think it has but id like to check that simpson whats the log on that
oh marvellous its the first real sleep ive had for the past two days	theres nothing like weightless sleep for a complete rest
thank you	incidentally dr floyd i wonder if i can have a word with you about the security arrangements
what do you mean	well the crew is confined to the ship when we land at clavius we have to stay inside for the time it take to refit  about twentyfour hours and then were going to back empty
well ill tell you why i ask you see ive got a girl who works in the auditing department of the territorial administrator and i havent been able to get her on the phone for the past week or so and with all these stories one hears im a little concerned about her	i see well im sorry about that i wouldnt think theres any cause for alarm
well fine thanks very much anyway and i hope you dont mind me asking	no of course captain i can understand your concern
our mission profile calls for discovery going to saturn true or false	true
our transit time is 257 days is that true	thats true
thats true	approximately five years after we go into hibernation the recovery vehicle will make rendezous with us and bring us back is this true
thats true	there is no other purpose for this mission than to carry out a continuation of the space program and to further our general knowledge of the planets is that true
hal have pod arms secure the component	roger

bullshit	its the only way youre gonna get ganz
this prison gives out 400 suits	what are you talkin about  this suits mine  it cost 900
were supposed to be after a killer not a string of hookers	listen it may be a little out of date you know i got a reputation for lookingreal sharp with the ladies
i dont need to hear your jive i already got that department taken care of	you got a girl shit the generosityof women never ceases to amaze me
hey no way  take off the bracelets or no deal	you just dont get it do your reggie  there isnt any deal i own your ass
no way to start a partnership	get this  we aint partners we aint brothers  we aint friends im puttin you down and keepin you down until ganz is locked up or dead  and if ganz gets away youre gonna be sorry we ever met
okay lets get down to it  i did my part and got you out  so now you tell me where were goin	dont worry i got a move for ya an awesome move a guy named luther ganzll be paying him a visit  we go to him right away
luther was part of the gang	what gang you talkin about jack
i can read a police file shithead and quit calling me jack	just an expression man dont mean nothin
i dont give a damn  it happens to be my name	then whatre you complainin about at least nobodys calling you shithead
just up the street the other side over there  now dont bother knockin on the door luther aint the kind of guy that looks for company	your pal nuts enough to take a shot at me
quit playin cop and undo this cuff jack i need to talk to this man	im tellin you to drop the goddam gun
i got a whole thing about people pointin guns at me	just throw me the goddamn gun
hey this works pretty good	thank you
what do you think	i think you better put him on ice man
hes gotta take that call  if there is one	if you let him run around till tuesday hes gonna run right to ganz and warn him aint you motherfucker
yeah well my ass bleeds for you and i didnt get you out so you could go on a goddamn trim hunt stop moaning	speakin of moans my stomach is startin to growl
we eat when i say we eat	bullshit  i aint moving  till i get something to eat youve been treating me like shit ever since i came out here  if you dont like it you can take me back to the penitentiary and kiss my hungry black ass goodbye  and i want some food some place nice some good people nice music
whod you call on the phone back at the booking station	just get in the car and keep your mouth shut
now where we goin convict	mission district  gonna find us an indian
i dont give out the details	last night two nights ago three
last night	you have a good time
sure  then we had a fight this morning	at least you took care of business and got the important part in before she came down on youtell me a little about her  she got great tits
if they kick my ass theyll sure as hell carve yours up	but you can handle it all right huh real amazin how far a gun and a badge can carry some cats
i been in a lot of bars where a white cop rousted me and some of the brothers all those clowns ever had going for em was a gun and a badge	you need five years training to handle a joint like
im gonna enjoy this  here ill even loan you my badge	i thought you said bullshit and experience are all it takes
this place dont seem real popular with the brothers	my kind of place i always liked country boys
that wasnt necessary buddy i got this under control	some of us citizens are with you all the way officer
you made that move huh	while youre at it you can give me the switchblade too
there	must be billys girl
maybe i dont like the way you ask	who gives a goddamn what you think youre just a crook thats got a weekendpass  youre not even a name anymore just a spear chucker with a goddamn number stenciled on the back of his prison fatigues
yeah right  you want to try again	naw youd just call your pals back to bail you out one more time
i been waiting a long time for some money	how much
half a million	jesus
just tell me about the money	me and my bunch hit a dealer in the middle of a sale its the kind of money nobody ever reports stolen i was sittin pretty livin in the high cotton then somebody fingered me for another job  some psycho whos out there capping people with some cops gun
hes after your money	you catch on real fastokay jack lets talk deal how much of my money you gonna let me keep
we split 5050	not likely convict
wheres the money	in the trunk of a car  a lot better than under a mattress right
right partner	get this we aint partners we aint brothers we aint friends if ganz gets away with my money youre gonna be sorry we ever met
wheres the goddamn car	youre a real case you know that jack
thisll show you how smart i am i got it parked	for three years  lets hope it wasnt a towaway zone
you son of a bitch you knew where the money was all along and all we had to do was come here and wait i almost got my ass blown off twice tonight for nothing	i wasnt sure the money was still there until we saw luther you almost got your ass shot off for nothing once not twice jack
you took a big chance leaving this here all this time	not really  i figured ganz was put down for a long time  and i knew luther would never job me on his own  hes too chickenshit
what	musta got some primo bondsman
jesus christ look at all the dust on my carwhy in the hell dont he take it to a car wash	didnt know you darker people went in for foreign jobs
youd think the guyd be smart enough to know he was being tailed	tryin to save his girl man hes in another world
if i was his size and had ganz on my ass id  just leave town	im tellin you the mans in love he wants to be a hero for his girl
i suppose youd never be like luther and let a woman get to you	i let women get to me  the quest for pussy is the meaning of life  i got my own personal philosophy about em  keep women separate from guns money and business  women are for spending money  they got nothing to do with helping you make it
say do you always work people over like you did luther	if they dont tell me what i need to know
doesnt it get tiring	im not in this cause its fun im not into hitting guys cause it makes me feel good either i do it cause it works
maybe luther hopes ganzll give him a piece of your money	if hes hoping that then hes dumber than i think he is which would be amazin cause i already think hes real dumb
a long time agb luther must of got the shit beat out of him so bad it just rattled his brain  that would account for him making so many wrong moves in a row	yeah it doesnt look like hes gonna make it as a dangerous tough guy
you know id be embarrassed if i let my wheels go the way youve done with this job	what you dont understand is i dont give a damn about how this thing looks
no class	class isnt somethin you buy punk look at you five hundred dollar suit and youre still a lowlife
were getting too close  cates whats the matter you been takin dumb pills	yeah most cops are pretty dumb but since youre the one that landed in jail whats that make you
that was in style a couple years back man	right if you ever switch from armed robbery to pimping then youre all set
hey jack how ya doin what took you so long to call man i been waitin  im at vromans up in the fillmore yeah vromans course you dont hang out here its for the brothers	ill be there in a minute you dont move your ass right
wheres luther	be polite say hello  this is candy
what about luther	what about ganz
we missed	you missed  luther took a taxi to the hotel across the street made a phone call
maybe we should pay luther a visit	let him get some sleep  hes going to need it
they must have set up a meeting for the morning luther left an 8 am wakeup and put up the dont disturb sign  hes trading his girl for the money  all we have to do to grab ganz is not go blind	so you took the rest of the night off
tell me something  why didnt you just take the money off luther and split	forget it i want ganz as bad as you do and i got some other news for you
i dont know why but im going to let you keep it maybe because you told me you had it or maybe just because im too tired to argue	you sure thats the reason
thanks for callin in and i guess maybe look im sorry i called you watermellon nigger those kinds of things i was just leanin on ya doin my job	bein good at your job dont explain everything jack 
yeah i see her	i can just take her right across the street to luthers hotel  all i need is some money for the room
that was quick	when you been in prison three years it dont take long lets go
why	luthers on the move
notice something funny about that bus	yeah it missed the last four stops
hey howd my car get here	i had it impounded  come on well use it for haulin you back to the slam
back to jail in my own car  ganz got away got all my money it just dont seem right	i dont know about you but i could use a drink ill buy you one  itll be my goodbye present
sorry we didnt do better jack i feel like i let you down	naw you didnt let me down  it was a long shot all the way  we gave em a good run at it
yeah well the only woman of the indians we ran into was shacked up with her dyke girlfriend  i guess she went with him before she came outta the closet  they both looked mad enough to kill him	yeah too bad  they were real nice lookin tooin bed together hardly any clothes one watching tv
do i get to kiss her too	if shes right and if you dont screw up
what if your girls theory turns out to be bullshit  i mean they could be in rio de janeiro	ive got to play it rough with them if they know anything im gonna know it
hey there she is	whatever play i maker just back me up
if we run into billy first let me try and talk him in	sure ill give you a shot at it but ganz is mine  you know that big indian plays it for keeps
yeah and i know ganz sure aint no sweetheart i wouldnt like it if this partnership ended before it gets started	partnership
okay reggie start bustin my chops tell me how great you were with that chick	hey jack real men dont have to go in for that macho bullshit  but i was fantastic
wait a minute cates  ive been waitin three years for that  i dont think its fair man what about the merit system you were gonnna give me a few thousand	theres nothin to talk about
its your money  itll be here in six months when you get out	and youre tellin me you dont want any of this cash
thats right not my style reggie	you are an awesomely weird cop sure wish there were more like you runnin around out here
thanks	no trouble jack but listen suppose i stay a crook  whered you get the idea that you could catch me
i want to be left alone on this one algren was killed with my gun	yeah i read the report
yeah	anthing botherin you besides losin your gun
yeah  it bothers me when cops get hurt while im makin a play i dont like it	you might be more of a team player and a little less of a hot dog on this one jack
yeah	try not to get your ass shot to pieces we got enough dead cops on this one
how did they get away	they ran  as fast as they could caught a train
which one pulled the trigger	the indian  i was about 30 yards away
what a screwup	right  i screwed up  i fucked up i messed up  anybody could have done better especially you i bet youre real good at hitting targets through crowds
dont duck the bullet cates why didnt you call in for backup instead of makin a grandstand play	i didnt have the time
where the christ do you think youre going	im taking my prisoner back to jail
but thats what you say about all of us all the tine  were always the ones fucking up when you tell it	the truth hurts doesnt it buddy
somebody steals your gun youre supposed to file a report	are you gonna tell me about police procedure  do me a favor dont give me a bunch of crap
is that what this guy ganz had in the hotel	every last bit of it  the big guys room was empty
this guy must have had a 44 like yours jack now hes got yours	shit
who are all these	they all pulled a bunch of jobs with ganz about four years ago
wait a minute wait a minute whos this	uhh  wong henry wong  he was in on the same job

hey youre right	youre hopeless
im all wet	whats wrong with that
a guy in the bar called me a dumb bitch today	whatd you do
irrigated his face with the shot of j and b id just poured him then i tried to deck the sucker	i guess he got the message
then i sit back and i think i mean whos to say im not a dumb bitch  i work in a bar right i cant read a list of my academic credentials to every boozehound that comes in the place you are what you do	positive selfimage problem all over again  you are who you decide you are unless youre the type that lets assholes decide for you
arent you the one that thinks all psychotherapy is bullshit	i do think all psychotherapy is bullshit but just because i think its bullshit doesnt mean i dont know something about it
if this is your idea of sympathetic interest in my problems ill take brutal indifference	hey you know what i really think
tell meim dyin to hear it	i think youre ashamed to tend bar which is sad because you look great in that outfit they make you wear you pull down four bills a week which is damn good and you mix the best pina coladas ive ever had i think that if you need bigger and better things  then go for em
you know if you let me come over to your place once in a while you could put on a clean shirt in the morning	what makes you think i have any clean shirts at my place
maybe you ought to buy me one	maybe i would if i knew when you were coming back
maybe that makes a nice excuse	maybe you dont know what the hell youre talking about
when you start with that attitude its like i dont know who you are	what do you want to know  what difference does it make  im the guy in your bed the last three months  i make you feel good you make me feel good  what the hell else do you want from a guy

you have a beautiful face the way the light hits it  id like to take your picture  you dont mind	id rather you didnt

 sorry	first things first  you might want to watch this mr welles
you got the guts tough guy  gonna kill us all is that it	you betrayed us
what can i do for you mr welles	call me tom
alright tom	what id like very simply is access to your archive  and now i understand this isnt something you normally do for private citizens
there are reasons for the way we do things here	absolutely  of course ill abide by whatever decision you make but id appreciate if youll hear me out
few days ago i was contacted by a couple living in philadelphia a doctor and his wife  what happened was they picked up a young girl hitchhiking off 81 which heads into philadelphia started up a conversation with this girl she looked homeless seemed about eighteen maybe  they convinced her to let them buy her a meal in the city  nice kid mature didnt have much to say but they got a sense shes a runaway so all through dinner the doctors working on her trying to convince her that at the very least she should pick up a telephone  not surprisingly she ate her food excused herself  thats the last they saw her  the reason they came to me for help the reason im coming to you is we had a friend of mine in the department work up a sketch  they want to see if i can id this girl somehow pass along a message to let the parents know the kids alive doing alright	why not go to the ncic or ncmec
i figured you share information	we do
for whatever reasons i thought you might be more receptive	why dont they come to me
this doctor and wife theyre nice people but they dont want to get too involved  theyre not trying to have the parents come looking for the girl either you and i both know sometimes not often but sometimes theres real reasons why a kidll run molestation whatever  besides that the girls probably eighteen so shes legal	im not so sure about this
theyre putting themselves in place of this kids parents and thinking theyd want to hear their girls okay even if thats all they hear	i can give you my card if your clients want to call me
they were pretty clear they didnt want this coming back on them	well thats all i can do  sorry
files are mostly by state and year of disappearance  we try to keep the children and adults separate no eating or smoking in here but theres a coffee machine in the hall	any good
its horrible but itll be your best friend after a few days  i hope you realize what kind of long shot youre chasing after	youre gonna be seeing a lot of me youre sure you dont mind
celebrity films	eddie
yeah whos this	i know what you did
who is this	you murdered that girl eddie  six years ago
what the fuck are you 	you killed that girl and you put it on film  you and your pals youre fucked  you fucked up real good
whats he talking about	one million dollars dino  how much did he tell you he had
im gonna kill you	dont bore me with that bullshit
starting to recognize a pattern	what do you want
who is machine	i dont know
okay well come back to that  so six years ago a guy contacts you through the classifieds over the phone however he does it  its longdale looking for a snuff film and you entrepreneur that you are tell him you can hook him up	yeah the fucking lawyer
how much did he pay you	thirty thousand each that fucking cocksucker
thats all  thirty each  thats all it took for you to murder her	it was a lot of fucking money
so you brought dino in and he brought machine  and one day a girl walked into your office because you had an ad in the paper for models  and she never walked out	something like that
what did you do knock her out shoot her up 	what the fuck do you want from me
i want to know  i want to know exactly what you did to her	fuck you then you want to know  i talked her up told her how beautiful she was told her she was gonna be a star  i told her i was gonna get her a screen test and while im doing that i got her a soda and dropped a mickey  when it was dark enough i rang dino and told him it was go time i put her in the trunk of my car and we went and we fucking did it  thats what happened  shes dead  shes been dead a long fucking time  nobody fucking cares
show me where you did it on the map exactly where you did it	why
i dont know  i felt like it  i never saw anyone get done before	you enjoy it
made me sick but what did i care what did i care if some hump wants to beat off to that  it was just something i was doing for money	tell me what happened
what do you want to know  you saw it you saw the loop	nobody saw you bring her in
there wasnt nobody around  this place was a shithole  i backed up the car to the door and we carried her in like groceries  dino made her eat a bunch of pills we laid out the plastic put film in the camera and machine went to work	what did you do with her body
keep moving	where do you think youre taking this huh  gonna be a big hero avenge that little girls death gonna make everything right with the world  how you gonna do that 
you cant go to the cops  all you can do is cut me loose and walk away because you got nothing	stop talking
i dont know   out there somewhere	where  show me where
do it  put me out of my misery so i dont have to listen to you whining anymore  you think its so easy	easy enough for you
i never killed anyone	thats right you just stood there and watched because you felt like it  almost makes you worse
you know how my tapes sell  people eat this stuff up	i had three jerkoffs trying to return your tapes last month  do you know how bad a skin flick has to be for some jackass to come back into my place with a fucking receipt and try to fucking return it
look you cocksucker	get together some upscale product where the girls still have teeth in their head  till then fuck you
yes i do have something to say  i insisted on being here as soon as i heard mrs christian contacted you	im listening
you are a private investigator	thats right
so he sent you gave you the money his errandboy  and if you refused it wasnt like you could tell anyone your pervert boss just asked you to get him a snuff film  thats the beauty of lawyerclient privilege	thats trust  mr christian trusted me implicitly
must have paid you a lot for you to risk everything  wouldve had to have cut yourself a real nice piece of money	i was well compensated
thats why you got scared when mrs christian hired me  you knew about the film figured it had to be in that safe  howd you find me	never mind how i found you
followed me must have freaked out when you saw me closing in on your buddies	theyre no friends of mine
except youre willing commit murder with them	none of this would be happening if you would have left it alone  if you werent digging up a girl who died six years ago  a girl no one even remembers
mary anne mathews was alive till you paid money to have her murdered	shut your mouth and drive
youre making me very angry	just tell me  tell me some more of the secrets you and christian shared what kind of degenerate pervert was he really  what the fuck did he want with a snuff film
youre asking me why	im asking
a man like mr christian a great man all his money all his power a man who attained everything there was to attain	why did he buy a film of some poor lost girl getting butchered
isnt it incredibly obvious	enlighten me
you almost went over your limit	fuck you
give me the film	youll get it when we get there
give me the film	go ahead shoot me  then try driving to brooklyn with my brains all over the windshield
hes lying	look at him  you think he played it square  how much did he give you how much did he keep for himself
big date tonight	yeah guess so
can i interest you in a battery operatedvagina	pardon me
my boss tells me i have to do more suggestive selling	well its tempting but no thanks
once you pick it up you cant put it down	catchy title  what are you really reading  hard to believe that books got any parts worth highlighting
truman capote	i tear off the cover and paste this one on  you know how it is
wouldnt want to embarrass yourself in front of your fellow perverts	might get drummed out of the pornographers union and then where would i be
remember me	came back for that batteryoperated vagina right  told you you would
i dont know what youre looking for mister but so were clear from the start im straight	good for you
well heres the deal max  this thing im on right now has something to do with underground pornography stuff thats sold under the counter illegally	theres not much illegal
well whatever there is whoevers dealing however its done i want to know  i want a good look so if youve got that kind of connection great  if not speak now	youre not a cop are you  if i ask and you are you have to tell me
im not a cop	youre a private eye  like shaft

well theres the thing youre not gonna know anything about what im doing but you can make some money	how much
how much do you make now	four hundred a week off the books
heres my number if you need it  when can you start	tomorrow night i get off at eight
 hello 	wake up pops  your education begins tonight
youve got penthouse playboy hustler etc  nobody even considers them pornography anymore  then theres mainstream hardcore  triple x  the difference is penetration thats hardcore  that whole industrys up in the valley writers directors porn stars theyre celebrities or they think they are  they pump out 150 videos a week  a week  theyve even got a porno academy awards  america loves pornography  anybody tells you they never use pornography theyre lying  somebodys buying those videos  somebodys out there spending 900 million dollars a year on phone sex  know what else  its only gonna get worse  more and more youll see perverse hardcore coming into the mainstream because thats evolution  desensitization  oh my god elvis presleys wiggling his hips how offensive  nowadays mtvs showing girls dancing around in thong bikinis with their asses hanging out  know what i mean  for the pornaddict big tits arent big enough after a while  they have to be the biggest tits ever  some porn chicks are putting in breast implants bigger than your head literally  soon playboy is gonna be penthouse penthousell be hustler hustlerll be hardcore and hardcore filmsll be medical films peoplell be jerking off to women laying around with open wounds theres nowhere else for it to go	interesting theory
what you saw tonight were not talking about a video some dentist takes home over the weekend  were talking about stuff where people get hurt  specialty product	child pornography
theres two kinds of specialty product legal and illegal  foot fetish shit films watersports bondage spanking fisting she males hemaphrodites its beyond hardcore but legal  this is the kind of hardcore where one guys going to look at it and throw up another guy looks at it and falls in love  now with some of the sm and bondage films they straddle the line  how are you supposed to tell if the person tied up with the ball gag in their mouth is a consenting or not  step over that line youre into kiddie porn  rape films but there arent many  ive never seen one	snuff films
i heard you asking  that guy wasnt yanking you around  theres no such thing	what other ways are there to get illegal films  who do you see
how old are you	twentyfive
where are your parents	i dont know where are yours
you just strike me as smart enough to be doing something else	yeah im a real genius  what choices have i got  fuck just because i know about stuff like tonight doesnt mean i deal it  i work a job  it beats pumping gas beats making hamburgers
what about me	i see a ring on your finger  you have any kids
a daughter	so you have a wife and kid waiting for you in pennsylvania what are you doing mixed up in all this
dino velvet yeah hes like the john luc godard of sm flicks supposed to be a real weirdo	a weirdo making sm films  whod have thought it
youre learning	where does he sell it
out of the back of bondage magazines mostly but you can find it on the street if you look  hell also do commissions for enough money	nothing illegal its always borderline  like if some freak wants to see a transvestite in a full rubber immersion suit getting an enema from a
alright i get the picture	he cuts all kinds of other stuff into his movies photographs newsreel footage subliminal images thinks hes making art
well im in new york now  what do you say to flying out and giving me a hand	im a working stiff pops
take a vacation  ill pay you four hundred a day plus expenses	you want me to come out there and play private eye
you didnt say it was gonna be this luxurious	its their presidential suite
oh come on man what are we doing in this flea bag	its cheap and people know to mind their own business what have you got for me
wha 	who is this in the mask  who is he
who is he	i told you hes one of dino velvets stock players
who is he his name	nobody knows his name  thats his thing  he always wears a mask  you never see his face  he calls himself machine thats what they call him  machine
you dont need to be here	what kind of junior pi would i be if i didnt go with you
whats this	its money  people use it to purchase goods and services
mister welles youre very prompt	i try to be
uh huh pleasure	apparently mr longdale has something he feels he simply must say before you and i speak
have a pleasant evening  will you have tea mister welles	thank you
hes odd	hes a lawyer  please sit here
ive spoken to friends of mine and my husbands in harrisburg in lancaster and hershey  asking about you  i must say you have friends in influential places	ive been privileged to provide services for people i admire
as you know my husband passed away recently  two weeks ago now	my condolences
his passing has left me with something of a dilemma  a terrible terrible dilemma	ill do whatever i can to help
he succeeded	we were married fortyfive years hard even for me to imagine  we had our troubles  there were plenty of places for him to be other than here but he was always loyal to me and i to him  i loved him deeply
do you carry a gun mr welles	i wear a gun when i can tell a client expects me to  other than that theres never any reason
my husband was the only one with the combination to this safe  i knew about it but as far as i was concerned it was none of my business  not till now that is	you hired someone to open it  ill bet the lawyer loved that
its a film of a girl being murdered	im afraid i dont
i didnt know what to think  i cant tell you how horrible its been to know this belonged to my husband  to know that he watched this this atrocity  but i cant go to the police	mrs christian please will you sit down a moment  i want you to listen carefully what youre talking about is a snuff film  but from what i know snuff films are a kind of urban myth  like red light district folklore  theres no such thing i can assure you
please believe me  this is probably a stag film  simulated rape  hard to stomach and it might seem real but there are ways of making it look realistic fake blood and special effects	no
if you were to study it youd see the camera cutting away youd see the tricks they can play	im telling you its not that
im sure it is  its probably something your husband was given as a bad joke  more than likely he never even watched it	will you watch it and see for yourself
you you need to go to the police	i told you i cant not yet
it wont work like that	any evidence you collect can be given to the police later anonymously  ive thought about it and theres no other way  if you cant find them if the only thing that comes from this film is that this is all my husband will be remembered for well i cant let that happen  im telling you i wont  if theres no chance that poor girls memory can be served then ill just have to spend my last days trying to forget her
i deal in divorce cases  corporate investigations	youve found missing persons before
nothing remotely like this	i know what im asking  your compensation will be appropriate to the risk  youll need cash to buy information and ill provide it  i feel responsible mr welles  you saw what he did to her
okay	my husband never dealt with money personally certainly not cash
im not positive this means anything	the checks were for odd amounts
totalled together these five checks from five different accounts they equal one million dollars	youre joking
hello 	im here
do you think the film could have cost that much	for a human life murder on film no statute of limitations  who knows  it sure could have  id like you to overnight me a copy of those checks then put them in a safe deposit box
okay	send it to me through the post office like we arranged  no return address  you dug this up all by yourself
hello	mrs christian tom welles here
how are you  having any luck	i dont know if lucks the word are you feeling alright
ive been ordered into bed  the doctor says ive gotten the flu or some other wretched ailment	i hope its nothing serious
nothing more than a bother  have you any news for me	ive made progress  im in manhattan  once a few more pieces fall into place ill drive to you and give you an update
ive got about five thousand left in cash but ill need another thirty if you approve	how will i get it to you
yes 	hello mrs mathews my names thomas jones im a state licensed investigator
ive been hired as an independent contractor by the us resource center for missing persons as part of an internal audit  if you have any time over the next few days id like to make an appointment to ask some questions about the disappearance of your daughter	i dont understand who are 
im sorry let me explain the rcmp is a support organization and archive not unlike the center for missing and exploited children in washington  im sure youve dealt with them before	yes but
what was the name  ive got it here somewhere	neil neil cole
right agent cole told me hed call and let you know to expect me  he didnt call	no
its very important you dont let this raise your expectations  its not going to effect any ongoing efforts  all im saying is please know im not here to create any false hope	they hired you  youre like a private detective
i didnt think there were private detectives anymore except on tv	you probably expect me to be wearing a trench coat and a hat  drinking whiskey chasing women and getting beaten up by guys with broken noses want to know what its really like its sitting in a car and staring at a hotel window for three days straight pissing in a plastic bottle pardon me because some guy thinks his wifes cheating on him glamorous huh  and the guy who hired you he has a hairlip dandruff and crooked teeth and you could have told him the minute you laid eyes on him his wifes cheating and you dont blame her
so she didnt leave a note  she never gave any indication where she might go before she left	no
she just seemed depressed 	she didnt seem herself  for months there never was any way to get her to talk about it  one night we went to bed the next morning she was gone  she took some clothes
what was she running from	i dont know
if theres anything you feel uncomfortable talking about tell me but i have to ask  your husband he committed suicide	yes
why do you think he did it	it got to be too much for him
i didnt mean to	you try going through what we did bob couldnt take it thats all christ theres times when it still seems like i cant either
i had to ask  i apologize	no one knows what its like  you cant even imagine how much it hurts
people remember me from the news  can you drive me back now	of course
i i shouldnt take anymore of your time  maybe we can finish tomorrow  ill call tomorrow	okay
doesnt make much sense does it when everythings happy when lifes fine and you have every reason to believe theres a god you dont bother  then something horrible happens thats when you start praying all the time  thats when you start going to church	were all like that
are you religious	no
ive got what i need for my report there is there is one thing that bothers me though	what
do you think the police did a good job	i dont know  i think so
it is possible and i know this isnt something you want to hear your daughter may have tried to hide a note where she thought you would eventually find it but where she knew your husband would never find it  she might have wanted to tell you something	no  you dont have any reason to think that
my husband never laid a hand on her she would have told me she would have told me	youre probably right and i probably wont find anything i dont have a right to ask this and you can kick me out of your house if you want but this is my profession and theres a part of me that cant let it go  police are just as human as you or i  they could have missed something  they probably didnt  wouldnt you rather know
you were right  i didnt find anything  im going to run and get something to eat are you hungry	yes
i think about it everyday  but every time the phone rings every single time i still think its her	its been six years
hello 	mrs mathews  its thomas  do you remember i was there a few weeks ago asking about your daughter
i remember  you just left	i have to tell you something  it wont be easy for you to hear  its about your daughter mary anne  when i when i was there with you her diary in your attic in silverware  if you read it youll know what im telling you is true
what are you talking about 	she went to california to los angeles she wanted to start over she wanted to be an actress
mrs mathews your daughter is dead shes dead	who is this 
someone some men they took your daughter and they drugged her and they took her to a motel room they did terrible things to her	who are you
they brought her into the room one man he put a knife to her throat and he raped her	no
he raped her andandand he murdered herhe cut her up with knifes	no no no
they killed her and they took her out in the forest somewhere and they buried her	why why are you doing this to me 
yes i remember mary	you you do  youre sure please sister will you take another look make sure
do you know what happened to her	im trying to find out  she was a runaway  im looking into it for her parents
what is this	those are her belongings
her belongings	thats her suitcase  i had forgotten it till you showed me her picture
whatever possessed you to keep this all this time	she was the kindest sweetest girl youd ever want to meet  oh i adored her  i supposed i always hoped shed be back  after a time all i could do was pray she had moved on to better things  can you get this suitcase to her parents if you think its appropriate
your soninlaw dealt with the dry cleaning franchise during the day saw that woman every night  the specifics are in the report and information about the woman  its unpleasant i know  i apologize	none too discreet is he
no sir he is not	hes an imbecile  i tried to warn my daughter but what can you do
the um youll find my invoice in the envelope if thats all	yes mister welles thank you
alright  may i have your phone number area code first	no you may not

im sure theyre around	yeah im not so sure
i love to dream i just hate ones about my dad	you could do worse
my mom taught me when i was little  did you ever hear of the dream master	sounds like a game show host to me
no really its a fable  the guardian of good dreams  it was like my teddy bear when i was growing up	great you wouldnt happen to know his phone number
i daydream  you have to dream about some place fun  remember youre in control	howd you learn so much about dreams

and so is your baby  youve got more than just yourself to think of now	what do you think im doing  look  whether you believe it or not krueger is back  hes after the baby and if i dont try to do something about it who will
all i know is that you are not doing yourself or the baby any good by acting like a crazy woman  why dont you take off  leave springwood and cool out somewhere for a while	goddamn it yvonne  you dont just run away from this guy  he finds you in your dreams
lookwere all tired  none of us had any sleep since friday night	thats the only reason youre alive
are you alright	yeahso thats him  and youre not crazy
you think thats the place shes buried	if they actually bothered to bury her
but how are we gonna 	weve got to go to the asylum and find her body  mark said her souls trapped with it  thats why she cant come to me  it must be
give up mark its hopeless	i think im starting to wear her down  have some anyway
not to mention the heartbreak of psoriasis	greta come on  one burger with me
mark are you okay	yeah  im just aces
i want to talk to both you guys about greta  and	im very fucking sorry but greta is dead today  could we interest you in someone else
i thought about that	she mustve fallen asleep at the table
then get out	mark
maybe it was her mother who killed her with all that polly perfect shit	it wasnt her mother  the only reason were still here is that none of us has slept since the grad party
tell me some more about this krueger guy	why dont i go make some coffee  theres a lot to tell
whoa slow down  howre you gonna hide from a guy like that leave the planet	i dont know
where are you going	im going to see what else i can find out about mr fred krueger
i couldnt do that mark  hes my last link with danno i want him	then well find another way
no its our problem mark  if i dont deal with this they really might try to take jacob  you said she committed suicide	thats what the newspapers thought  she spent the rest of her life in the asylum after kruegers trial she flipped out and hung herself so they thought
they couldnt prove it  no body  nuns bumping themselves off is bad for business	but ive seen her grave
poor woman	no shit
i dont understand	she killed herself  her souls gonna be in torment
yeah when are you gonna come to your senses	next life  oh whats that

dan  and hes taking alice with him  pretty good dive yvonne  youve been practicing	two hours a day six days a week
vomit	faint
why dont you shut up and let her talk two of us died in the last two days does that strike you as particularly normal	mark
im not finished  i loved greta  a lot and if maybe just maybe someone or some thing killed her id like to hear about it	i cant listen to this
its okay	stick around please
i should have suspectcd when i heard that doctor  i thought it was your father	it was supposed to be  dad had a heart attack two days ago
how is he  	it was moderate  hell be all right  but it was out of the question his coming along
what is it	your out  this came for you 
my father  hes not  	dead  matter of fact hes much better hes left the hospital
what did you mean  im out	your father can be in nome alaska tomorrow  we have two choices ask them to send him out in a copter and take you off or the shark can put back into nome
you trade school boys are all alike arent you  anybody who doesnt happen to think like a little goldbraided puppet is ipso facto a coward	uyouu said it  but i wont argue 
wearing a uniform doesnt bestow an automatic monopoly on courage ucommanderu  it just so happens im unotu a coward  physical or mental  and before id risk my fathers life	were uallu risking our lives
that may be  but dad stays where uheu is and im staying here	youre really a mixedup oddball arent you
perhaps  but the idea of willingly going to uschoolu to spend my ulifeu at a paleozoic pastime that should have disappeared with the thunderlizards  im referring to war  uthatu strikes me as the uworstu cowardice of all  being spiritually yellow	you mean unothingu is worth fighting for
peace  the dignity of man  the destiny of the human spirit  show me a man who says you win uthoseu by fighting wars and uillu show you an idiot	you may not uwinu them  but without men like your father to degrade himself by fighting to preserve them  or as much as we have of them  theyd have disappeared ulongu ago
unidentified flying objects	thenthis is a flying saucer
thats enough holloway  ive told you before wearing boards on your shoulders and parading with a stiff spine doesnt auto matically endow you with back bone  	 any more than being the son of captain neilsen does
however our ideas disagree as ive said before im unotu a coward  and it happens youve got no choice  either uiu take you down there in the lungfish or you dont get there 	id sooner swim
theyre so remote  cold  beautiful the stars  but now  i wonder 	yes
maybe  just maybe  when their ship doesnt return  theyll decide not to come here after all	but if they udou
i dont know	i wouldnt worry  so long as we have boats like the tiger shark  and people like you the skipper dave kent sir ian and my father 
reef	so they caught up with you too
at the worst possible moment tomorrow is janies birthday poor little kid has looked forward for two months to having her daddy home  now 	uthatsu the worst possible moment
youve asked why i stay a bachelor there goes the best reason i know	huh
i guess skipper neilsen re tired before you enrolled at the academy didnt he	i guess
one of the finest men and officers alive  a real hero  in the best sense of the word  in world war two  he taught us engineering and design fought like a demon to develop atom subs	so
so all of a sudden his only son drops out of school be gins making noises like a pacifist  a real egghead dogooder and crackpot  ban the atom tests  junk the nuclear subs  spend the mili tary budgetfor peace	a lot of people think like that
but utheyreu not skipper neilsens son  it broke his heart  then when some newspapers called carl the honest sincere son of a warmongering father  captain neilsen resigned from the navy  oh he still keeps his hand in  playing around with projects like the lungfish  but it broke him all the same	have you ever talked to carl  tried to see his side
cyclops	sounds like it  distress call from a small freighter between ellesmere island and greenland one mayday thennothing
were stuck tight	skipper  look at the depth gauge
i think youre right	go back and tell dr neilsen have him report to the skipper
yeah	listen  hear that
i dont hear anything  maybe youve been down here too long  why dont you go back up and 	strange you didnt hear it omit 274f
hey  you know somethin  its getting lighter in here	you know  it uisu
and if i didnt uknowu better  id swear we were moving	lets get back to work and maybe we uwillu be soon
you hear that	the sound again
where do you think the voice you heard was coming from	somewhere down there
wonder where powell and carney are	well have to look for them later
well	im with uyouu
here  keep these  it wants me to come alone	oh it does
dave  	whats goin on in here lad what  
get ready  we shove off as soon as griff reports all the crew aboard	right skipper
is there any way out of it	seems to be all around
what about down	idont know
a mass of jellylike stuff came out of the thing and caught our torpedo	what
what course skipper	right at our oneeyed friend
you better take powell and carney with you 	the frogmen
with their underwater experience theyll be invaluable  take sidearms and flare pistols 	sidearms  but the saucers dead
excuse me skipper	yes griff
skipper  could you take a look here	something wrong
the inertial navigation system must have been knocked out in the crash	why do you say that
were dead in the water  but it indicates were moving	what
we read you  go ahead doctor  theyre inside the saucer  its filled with breathable air	wonderful
excuse me captain  there may be one last desperate chance  a oneinathousand shot	anything 
above murmansk and finland	suppose our theorizing is correct then this ucouldu be the next danger point
we took for granted his source of energy was nuclear  but suppose it isnt at all  what if its umagneticu	uweu harness energy on a small scale by cutting magnetic lines of force  maybe cyclops does it on a usuperu scale
in such a way as to prevent his returning to it and as you put it  recharging his batteries	if we were lucky enough to catch him with his power depleted
the radiation level  from the saucer  its rising	what direction does the system indicate
as we near the pole	theres got to be an explanation
thought you were going to washington skipper	i did go  just back  reef these are a couple of our passengers  sir ian hunt and dr clifford kent  my exec commander richard holloway
doctor neilsen  when did uthatu happen	huh
what do you think	i think i should have joined the air force
determine extent of damage immediately	after torpedo room  report
youre sure its cyclops	take a look
whats the running time	thirtyfour seconds
but  what can we accomplish	we can uramu him
a hundred and eighty fathoms we cant be sinking that fast	its the screws skipper  at our declination angle running in reverse theyre pulling the shark uandu cyclops right to the bottom
straight to the pole  at almost fifty knots	nothing we can do now
remove your weapons commander and come here  alone	come where
my mission is to study various solar systems and planets  select the most suitable for colonization 	 for horrors like yourself
swell	your friend was to remain where he was
he did	i am afraid not  therefore 
why	i have selected you to return with me  along with several other specimens for study  we will examine you and the others discover desirable features to incorporate in our earthcolonizers
it is a living thing  when damaged  you would say wounded  it immediately heals itself	thats why no water leaked inside when we rammed you
to navigate wont you have to see your way	obviously
my yeoman will show you to your quarters	thank you
see what	the pattern  each incident occurred almost precisely a thousand statute miles from the pole  a line through the points of occurrence makes almost a complete circle
well ill be  	ill be another
just musing about our oneeyed adversary and the legend of homer  cyclopes were the sons of heaven who forged the thunder bolts thrown by zeus	our cyclops throws quite a thunderbolt itself
you plotted the course of cyclops  then thats uouru course  wherever uheu goes uweu gountil we get him	or perhaps until he gets us
are you alright wade	yeah sure why i got this damned tooth i got a few things bugging me like everybody else but im okay

i screwed up the divorce i agreed with everything she said i wanted her to like me i just want to be a good father	it would help if you were married if there was someone at home while you work
i plan to soon	how soon

it looks pretty hopeless dont it	no not exactly ill look at the divorce decree see if we can get it redrawn interview your daughter jill right
jesus how much how much will the whole thing cost	hard to say if we go for custody depositions psychiatric evaluations it could drag on ten or twelve thousand dollars she could win on appeal if we just want to get the visitation rights redrawn assuming theyre unduly restrictive it wouldnt be more than twentyfive hundred

jacks sort of sensitive i guess more than most but hell be okay in a few weeks	theres something funny about that shooting theres lots funny about it actually
i heard he was drunk at tobys last night and got in a fight with hettie he drove off without her	im sure im positive it didnt happen the way jack says it did
jacks turned into one of those men who are permanently angry he used to be a sweet kid but its like when he found out he couldnt play ball anymore he changed now hes like everyone else	ive been wondering if maybe jack shot twombley instead of twombley shooting himself ive been wondering maybe jack shot him on purpose
money	jack doesnt need money
everybody needs money except guys like twombley and that sonofabitch soninlaw of his people like that	jack wouldnt kill for it besides who would pay him
lots of people guy like evan twombley boston union official probably got lots of people want to see him dead the governments been investigating his links with the mafia	the mafia hire jack hewitt
no i just know jacks lying about what happened he just seemed  i know that kid what hes like inside hes a lot like i was at his age	you wouldnt have done anything like that shot someone for money
no not for money but if somebodyd given me half a damned excuse  i was pretty fucked up you know	but not now
i can see what you looked like as a kid	you knew me as a kid
yeah but never what you looked like not really never really studied your face like now i was never able to see you as a kid when you were a kid until now this way	what way
dont you think do you still think its a good idea to press this custody thing  just now	im her father  supposed to be but im not able to yes yes i am it may be the only thing in my life ive been so clear about wanting even if it takes a big fight
then i guess you have to	theres another thing ive been thinking about i dont know how you feel about the idea margie because weve never talked about it but ive been thinking lately ive been thinking we should get married sometime you and me
oh wade	ive been thinking about it thats all
youve been married twice 	it was to the same woman i was just a kid  its not like a marriage proposal or anything just a thought something for you and me to talk about and think about you know

yeah i know him  the kid that was with him maybe you do too jack hewitt he works for lariviere with me hes my best friend	wade its late i know youre probably at tobys but im in bed reading we got different habits
itll come out jack lied and the kidll get hung for it	he was scheduled to testify for a committee investigating organized crime in new england and the construction business
who	twombley
no shit	you think jack shot him
well it was an accident	they were out deer hunting right jack probably heard the gun go off then came back and found the body
picked up jill she was supposed to visit for the weekend for halloween she wanted to go home	who
dont think about it youre exhausted	yeah i guess
havent you already done a bit of that	no no i havent not really ive growled a little but i havent bit
pointless to stand around in church with nothing to do i guess	what about jill is lillian bringing her
well do you still plan to get married	yeah shell probably quit her job and stay out here with pop we cant leave him alone here hell set the damn place on fire with jill here a lot itll be good to have margie around things are going to change in that department by the way i got a custody lawyer in concord im gonna see him tomorrow all hells gonna break loose but its worth it
i want to let the gas run out i dont want the bastard driving drunk and hes always drunk now after well hide the keys	anything new about the shooting twombley
i guess it was an accident like everybody thinks	want to know what i think happened
motive you gotta have a motive	money
whod pay him that kind of money not the mob they got their own guys specialists	they wouldnt deal with a guy like jack who else benefits if twombley is suddenly dead
yeah the guy with the bmw i told you about i did didnt i	heres my theory twombley unaware of illegal union loans or whatever starts nosing around cause of the investigation and finds out finds out his soninlaw is involved
its too neat things aint that neat it makes me mad that somebody can pay to kill somebody his own fatherinlaw and not be punished for it dont that piss you off	not particularly
rights right goddamnit dont you care whats right	i care about what happened the truth im a student of history remember
i was thinking about that story you told me about pop and chopping the firewood out of the ice and after	yeah
i hate to disappoint you but i dont think it happened	of course it happened why would i lie about it
it may have happened but not the way you said	you think i wouldnt remember a thing like that
it wasnt me i wasnt there but i heard about it when i heard about it it was about elbourne	wed have to go digging in vietnam to ask him
and elbourne and mom took you to the doctor and told him you fell from the hay loft	well i never heard that one
i remember clearly cause when i heard i became real careful around pop i was a careful child and i became a careful adult but at least i wasnt afflicted by that mans violence	thats what you think
then you accidentally see your body or your face or whatever and you dont know who the hell it belongs to strange its the business with the old man i know and how incredibly pissed i was at him and also chasing jack hewitt like that and the goddamned truck going through the ice not to mention margies being so upset  one thing on top of another	wade are you alright
i know what it means im just running out of ways to use it	for what
to help jack of course  and to nail those sonsofbitches the two gordons thats what alma calls them jesus rolfe whose side are you on	take care of the little things first the things that are distracting you from taking care of the big things call chub merritt get your car back call a dentist for gods sake and get your tooth pulled dont trust the locals get your facts straight and go straight to the state police let them work on this

twenty minutes	you heard me  you congress and cabinet heads
madame vice president we have an options paper  chandler takes the options paper waves off lee and reads it as she talks	yes youve made yourself quite clear

please mr president youre going to get yourself killed is that your solution	freeing stravanavitch is gonna get tens of thousands killed i cant live with that  im not royalty im an elected official and the integrity of the office of the president is infinitely more important than the man who holds that office  we dont negotitate not as long as im president is that understood

elaine youre a member of this crew can you face some unpleasant facts	no

he didnt recognize me	it is his new partner that im worried about
when we picked him up he was talking to those two cops  the two who came to question you about hubley	this is getting out of hand  i want you to deal with it  immediately
 and we work my hours  ill do the driving you do the paperwork you gotta learn it so you might as well do it all	sergeant id like to thank you for what youre doing
whats that  look jetson  get this straight in your head  were not pals were not married and we aint gonna take long moonlight walks together were just partners  and dont call me sergeant  call me sykes or matt if you have to	i am george
man somebody really hung one on you  ive heard some good ones for you guys humphrey bogart harley davidson  i guess the people at immigration got a little punchy after a while coming up with names for a quarter of a million of you you werent at the back of the line were you george	my true name is sstangya tssorentsa
lets talk hubley	his body was discovered three days ago in an alley off of central avenue near downtown
with two bri sabot slugs in the chest	through the chest  rupturing both the primary and secondary hearts
the guys at the minimart last night made a halfassed stab at the money in the till  but i dont think thats what they were there for  i think we got us a couplea executions on our hands george	the murder at the minimart is not our case  the captain said
what is wrong	nothings wrong  i just want to get something straight  you agree that theres a good chance these two shootings are somehow related right
yes no it is not unreasonable although i	great  well im sure glad thats settled arent you
nothing	shouldnt we examine their personal effects
what is this	a rubber  a condom  you know coney island whitefish  men human men put them on their uh  penises  to protect against having babies  you need this for anything
well yeah its rubber  it stretches	and still it fits
a large number of my people were hired by refineries because the methane fumes are not harmful to us my spouses brother is one	so the slag theyre cutting into upstairs worked at a refinery just like hubley worked at a refinery  id say that possible connection between the two cases just got a hell of a lot more possible  okay next step  i gotta go talk to the wife of the slag store owner blown away last night
i believe i should interview the widow alone	why the hell  great fine  you talk to the wife
a week ago two men came to see her husband  after they left he was very frightened  she identified one of the men from a photo i showed her  it was hubley	awright  what about the other guy
she didnt know him  but she said her son might	did you talk to him
rudyard kipling  no shit  listen we just need a minute of your time	wed like to ask you about a business associate of your warren hubley
why did you do it	whyd i do what
who said that	at the end of the bar
your name wouldnt happen to be porter would it	uh matthew
back off george	but i 
tell me	your mother mates out of season
you know that guy	from quarantine when my people first arrived here  he and i were housed together
if i may make a suggestion we have different weak spots than you do  next time a blow to the nerve plexus under the arm here will produce the effect i think you were looking for	yeah sure  i knew that
which one is that  raw what	this is mole  its good
ill bet  would it really put you out if they tossed that on the grill for a minute or two	our bodies do not assimilate the nutrients if the food has been cooked
and what was that one about my mother  that was a good one	sstrokya sslato na
who is he	todd watson  the assistant manager
we were chasing you because you ran you dumb sonofabitch	when will strader return
so she keeps you on a pretty short leash does she	my wife  she worries about me
yeah i know the routine	you are married
your home is quite disordered  i thought perhaps you had been burglarized when i walked in	i appreciate your honesty george
human children can be very beautiful  getting married  congratulations you will be taking sunday off then	maybe not i dont know  im not sure im gonna go  she doesnt need her burnout of a father there
 and so and so the doctor says if this is the thermometer then whered i leave the pen  youre not you dont think thats funny  george work with me i always get a laugh with that one look if the doctors got the thermometer in his hand then wheres his pen gotta be	in the other mans rectum
your health	ta sstrakyona
there is so much our two peoples dont understand about each other	no shit holmes  youre only from another goddamn planet for chrissakes
i hope you can understand how special your world is how unique a people you humans are  so it us all the more painful and confusing to us that so few of you seem capable of living up the the ideals you set for yourselves	dont count on me george  i never had any ideals
whered you get this	a man a human was wiring it to your car  i didnt get a good look at him  i must call my wife
shes going to divorce me	george shes not gonna divorce you you mate for life remember
stop the car	why
whats this nothing shit  it wasnt nothing yesterday when you asked bentner to run that test and he looked like he was about to shit peach pits and its not nothing now  dont lie to me george youre bad at it	you must leave me alone on this
no secrets goddammit  you dont hold back from me  whatever is going on youre gonna tell me now	no  i cannot involve you  this is not your concern
the hell it isnt when somebody wires up enough c4 explosive to my car to turn me into pink mist  that slag was on something and not sour milk either  am i right  tell me  what is it	 it is called ssjabroka  to us it is a potent narcotic
how potent	like your cocaine i suppose  the high lasts several hours  we would receive small amounts of it as a reward for our labor
we  youve taken it	we all did
where did he get it  was there any of it on the ship	no i am sure not  that is why i am so concerned someone must now be producing it here  but none of my people know how to make it  the process was carefully guarded
jesus this is major  why didnt you tell me sooner whyd you hold out on me	your people dont know about this part of out past  and they cant know  it would threaten our entire existence here
they had months in quarantine to develop the plan  porter with his chemistry background must have somehow come up with the formula for the drug  hubley manufactured it  at the refinery  strader through the nightclub established a distribution network  and harcourt	harcourt was the brain who brought it all together
okay george  we gotta play this real smart	if the drug is here we must destroy it
george uh youre gonna break his little chest bones	stay out of this matthew  tell me where the drug has been taken or i will crush your lungs against this wall
george cmon  lighten up  its a beauty of a case  dont sweat it  we got him by the short hairs he aint gonna make any more of the shit	the fifty kilos matthew  i have to find it  i cant let it get out on the street
	fuck procedure
shit	ssai
with harcourt and kipling dead i assume you will be requesting reassignment now	itd be for your own good  i think youd be better off with a partner whos a little more by the book   still i gotta tell you george for a quiet guy youre sure hell on wheels once you get going  id kinda hate to miss your next two days as a detective
whats this about george  i know that look	there  go back  down that side street
no  we must do this alone	do what  george 
what is this	 its harcourt
harcourt is dead	no hes not  not if he overdosed on the drug  massive amounts trigger a a change  your body functions seize up you appear to be dead but its really a state of incubation  when you emerge youre
i never thought id say this but  for once in my life i think im willing to wait for backup	we cant let him get away
how do i look	you look very good
casull 454 magnum  youre talking twice the impact energy of 44 magnum hot loads	only holds five
mr hubley was an all right guy  and a damn good manager  the men liked him  im really gonna have to scramble to fill his shoes	well one of the men didnt like him so much
to be honest its hard to say  i hate to admit it but  they all still kinda look alike to me	who else can i ask around here
wait  you know who it looks like yeah  anderson  uh james anderson  he isnt in today  he took the afternoon off	i think youre gonna find hes taken the rest of his life off
that where anderson worked	yes it is  thirtyfive percent pure methane gas in there  i dont know how these fellas do it
dont piss him off oneal  when he gets like this i cant control him ive seen this before  he got like this once  i saw him jerk a guys spine out and show it to him nothing i could do  i hadda go throw up	 they took the stuff out all of it  this afternoon
heres hubley  left quarantine on november thirtieth relocated first to riverside then moved to los angeles early in february the following year  field of expertise chemical manufacturing  looks like he passed up several other better paying jobs waiting for that one at the refinery	try joshua strader will ya darlin
released december one  he and his wife moved first to modesto then coalinga california  wherever that is  settled in la in april  field of expertise organic chemical engineering  he and his wife have one child a son	yeah  we met him  wonderful boy close personal friend of georges here
can you dig up their quarantine records in this thing	sure  just a minute
jesus are the questions too tough for you already  lets try again  is your name porter	sskyata
you know ive been over all this with fedorchuk and alterez this morning	come on  you got nothin better to do cushy county job like yours
no id on him and  well you know no fingerprints  so it could be tough  your buddies this morning went through the mug book but couldnt make a facial match	fedorchuk couldnt find his ass with his hands in his back pockets
you took this gut out too didnt you	yeah
oh heres an extra headshot if you need one  were just about to start cutting in  youre welcome to stick around if you want  its really fascinating stuff	yeah ill bet

yeah sykes	captain  id like to volunteer for duty with the new detective

which would mean lots of those parasites right  one for each personover a hundred at least	yes  that follows
but these things come from eggsso where are all the eggs coming from	that is the question of the hour  we could assume a parallel to certain insect forms who have hivelike organization an ant of termite colony for example is ruled by a single female a queen which is the source of new eggs
youre saying one of those things lays all the eggs	well the queen is always physically larger then the others  a termite queens abdomen is so bloated with eggs that it cant move at all  it is fed and tended by drone workers defended by the warriors  she is the center of their lives quite literally the  mother of their society
could it be intelligent	hard to say  it may have been blind instinctattraction to the heat of whateverbut she did choose to incubate her eggs in the one spot where we couldnt destroy her without destroying ourselves  thats if she exists of course
thats it  see it  emergency venting	how long until it blows

youre mad shes mad wolfi	oh yes and who are you hes worked for kings for the emperor  who are you
when may i ask	in three months papa
what is ridiculous wolfi has many admirers in vienna they love him here people send us gifts all the time	but you cant take her without reference its unheard of

behold	behold
behold	behold

i am sorry madame but no i cannot let anyone pass	young man i am no stranger to theatres im no stranger to insolence
upstairs	gertrude
ive heard about you for ages i thought you must be an old man	gertrude
its such an honour for us to have you here herr mozart and for gertrude	people who know say the girls got talent you must judge for yourself if you think she stinks say so
i said play	michael
what a strange young man	yes he is a little strange
perhaps a little refreshment first a little coffee or a little chocolate	id like a little wine if you have it
just one year	who was your teacher
i was but she quite outgrew the little i could show her	thank you madame  come on now  courage play me something you know
what a charming idea may i see	its just a trifle of course
may i try it	majesty
delightful court composer would you permit me to play it as he comes in	you do me too much honour sire
and here is our illustrious court composer herr salieri	finally such an immense joy diletto straordinario
my pleasure	well there it is now to business young man we are going to commission an opera from you what do you say
well im glad to hear that	excuse me sire but what do you think these could be being a foreigner i would love to learn
good morning court composer this is my niece the princess elizabeth	your highness
you already commissioned an opera from mozart	and the result satisfies
yes of course my concern is to protect you from any suspicion of favouritism	ahha favouritism but i so want mozart
im sure there is a way majesty some kind of a little contest i could perhaps put together a small committee and i could see to it naturally that it will select according to your majestys wishes	you please me court composer a very clever idea
i dont think you understand me court composer	majesty i did believe me it was a most agonizing decision but finally i simply could not recommend herr mozart
why not	well sire i made some inquiries in a routine way i was curious to know why he had so few pupils it is rather alarming
majesty i dont like to talk against a fellow musician	of course not
do you like this salieri	it is not a question of liking your majesty your own law decrees it im afraid
your majesty	no no please it is not a holy relic  you know we have met already in this very room perhaps you wont remember it you were only six years old  he was giving the most brilliant little concert here as he got off the stool he slipped and fell my sister antoinette helped him up herself and do you know what he did jumped straight into her arms and said will you marry me yes or no
and now he has returned the compliment herr salieri composed that march of welcome for you	really oh grazie signore sono commosso e un onore per mo eccezionale compositore brilliante e famossissimo
majesty	did we vote in the end for german or italian
why so	because ive already found the most wonderful libretto
it is new it is isnt it sire	yes indeed
and german	oh yes absolutely german unquestionably
i dont understand there are just as many notes majesty as are required neither more nor less	my dear fellow there are in fact only so many notes the ear can hear in the course of an evening i think im right in saying that arent i court composer
majesty this is madame weber she is my landlady	enchanted madame
excuse me but how old are you	twentysix
majesty may i ask you to do me the greatest favour	what is it
may i introduce my father he is on a short visit here and returning very soon to salzburg he would so much like to kiss your hand it would make his whole stay so memorable for him	ah by all means
mozart are you aware i have declared the french play of figaro unsuitable for our theatre	yes sire
yet we hear you are making an opera from it is this true	who told you this majesty
it is not your place to ask questions is it true	well yes i admit it is
would you tell me why	well majesty it is only a comedy
but majesty this is just a frolic its a piece about love	ah love again
but its new its entirely new its so new people will go mad for it for example i have a scene in the second act  it starts as a duet just a man and wife quarreling suddenly the wifes scheming little maid comes in unexpectedly  a very funny situation duet turns into trio then the husbands equally screaming valet comes in trio turns into quartet then a stupid old gardener  quartet becomes quintet and so on  on and on sextet septet octet how long do you think i can sustain that	i have no idea
guess guess majesty imagine the longest time such a thing could last then double it	well six or seven minutes maybe eight
ahha well then we should make some effort to acquire him we could use a good german composer in vienna surely	i agree majesty but im afraid its not possible the young man is still in the pay of the archbishop
ahha what do you say chamberlain	in my opinion it is time we had a piece in our own language sir plain german for plain people
yes sir	well there it is
well what do you have for me today	your majesty herr mozart 
i write to you with urgent news i am coming to vienna take no further steps toward marriage until we meet you are too gullible to see your own danger as you honour the father who has devoted his entire life to yours do as i bid and await my coming	i will

what is this mozart whats the matter with you	well since it appears nobody is eager to hire my services could you favour me with a little money instead
what for	if a man cannot earn he must borrow
well this is hardly the way to go about it	no doubt sir but i am endowed with talent and you with money if i offer mine you should offer yours
im sorry no	please ill give it back i promise please sir
mio caro adone	ah
love sire	ah love well of course in italy we know nothing about that
yes yes er on  the whole yes majesty	but this is absurd
dear mozart my sincere congratulations	did you like it then
how could i not	it really is the best music one can hear in vienna today dont you agree
herr mozart what brings you here	your excellency you requested some specimens of my work here they are i dont have to tell you how much i need your help i truly appreciate your looking at these i have pressures on me  financial pressures as you know im a married man now
so you are how is your pretty wife	she is well she is  well actually im about to become a father she only told me last night you are the first to know
im flattered and congratulations to you of course	so you see this post is very important to me right now
why didnt you come to me yesterday mozart this is a most painful situation yesterday i could have helped you today i cant	why here is the music its here i am submitting it humbly isnt that what you wanted
i have just come from the palace the post has been filled	filled thats impossible they havent even seen my work i need this post please cant you help me please
my dear mozart there is no one in the world i would rather help but now it is too late	whom did they choose
herr sommer	sommer herr sommer but the mans a fool hes a total mediocrity
no no no he has yet to achieve mediocrity	but i cant lose this post i simply cant excellency please lets go to the palace and you can explain to the emperor that herr sommer is an awful choice he could actually do musical harm to the princess
theyre stupendously successful you cant get a seat the only problem is none will hire me they all want to hear me play but they wont let me teach their daughters as if i was some kind of fiend im not a fiend	of course not
do you have a daughter	im afraid not
well could you lend me some money till you have one then ill teach her for free thats a promise oh im sorry im being silly papas right  i should put a padlock on my mouth seriously is there any chance you could manage a loan only for six months eight at most after that ill be the richest man in vienna ill pay you back double anything name your terms im not joking im working on something thats going to explode like a bomb all over europe	ah how exciting tell me more
id better not its a bit of a secret	come come mozart im interested truly
actually its a big secret oh this is delicious what is it	cream cheese mixed with granulated sugar and suffused with rum crema al mascarpone
ah italian	forgive me we all have patriotic feelings of some kind
two thousand two hundred florins is all i need a hundred fifty	what exactly are you working on
i cant say really	i dont think you should become known in vienna as a debtor mozart however i know a very distinguished gentleman i could recommend to you and he has a daughter will that do
really why	i dont know they say ive got to rewrite the opera but its perfect as it is i cant rewrite whats perfect cant you talk to him
why bother with orsinirosenberg hes obviously no friend of yours	oh i could kill him i mean really kill him i actually threw the entire opera on the fire he made me so angry
you burned the score	oh no my wife took it out in time
but there are those who have power over him i think ill take this up with the emperor	oh excellency would you
with all my heart mozart	thank you oh thank you
nine performances nine thats all its had  and withdrawn	i know its outrageous still if the public doesnt like ones work one has to accept the fact gracefully
but what is it they dont like	well i can speak for the emperor you made too many demands on the royal ear the poor man cant concentrate for more than an hour and you gave him four
what did you think of it yourself did you like it at all	i think its marvelous truly
its the best opera yet written i know it why didnt they come	i think you overestimate our dear viennese my friend do you know you didnt even give them a good bang at the end of songs so they knew when to clap
i know i know perhaps you should give me some lessons in that	i wouldnt presume all the same if it wouldnt be imposing i would like you to see my new piece it would be a tremendous honour for me
oh no the honour would be all mine	grazie mio caro wolfgang
mozart it was good of you to come	how could i not
did my work please you	how could it not excellency
yes	i never knew that music like that was possible
you flatter me	oh no one hears such sounds and what can one say but  salieri
i am only a messenger do you accept you will be paid well	how much
what happened is it over	im taking you home youre not well
where is your wife	not here shes not well either she went to the spa
you mean shes not coming back	youre so good to me truly thank you
oh no it is a sublime piece the grandest operone i tell you you are the greatest composer known to me	do you mean that
i do	i have bad fancies i dont sleep well anymore then i drink too much and think stupid things
are you ill	the doctor thinks i am but 
shall i answer it	no no its him
who	the man hes here
wait ask him if hed give me some money now tell him if he would that would help me finish it	finish what
would you actually you could	my dear friend it would be my greatest pleasure
but youd have to swear not to tell a soul im not allowed	of course
you know its all here in my head its just ready to be set down but when im dizzy like this my eyes wont focus i cant write	then let us try together id regard it as such an honour tell me what is this work
where did i stop	the end of the recordare  statuens in parte dextra
so now the confutatis confutatis maledictis when the wicked are confounded flammis acribus addictis how would you translate that	consigned to flames of woe
do you believe in it	what
strange	come lets begin
yes	so now  a minor suddenly
start with the voices basses first second beat of the first measure  a  confutatis  second measure second beat  maledictis  gsharp of course	yes
third measure second beat starting on e  flammis acribus addictis  and fourth measure fourth beat  d  maledictis flammis acribus ad dictis  do you have that	i think so
good now the tenors fourth beat of the first measure  c  confutatis  second measure fourth beat on d  maledictis  all right	yes
now the orchestra second bassoon and bass trombone with the basses identical notes and rhythm  the first bassoon and tenor trombone 	please just one moment
it couldnt be simpler	first bassoon and tenor trombone  what
with the tenors	also identical
and thats all	oh no now for the fire  strings in unison  ostinato on all  like this
do you have me	i think so
thats wonderful	yes yes  go on the voca me suddenly sotto voce write that down sotto voce pianissimo voca me cum benedictis call me among the blessed
c major sopranos and altos in thirds altos on c sopranos above  voca voca me voca me cum bene dictis	sopranos up to f on the second voca
do you want to rest a bit	oh no im not tired at all
well stop for just a moment then well do the lacrimosa	i can keep going i assure you shall we try
would you stay with me while i sleep a little	im not leaving you
i am so ashamed	what for
oh have i seen it	i  i dont think you have herr director not yet i mean its quite n  of course ill show it to you immediately
then why especially does it have to be in german	well not especially it can be in turkish if you really want i dont care
what you think mozart is scarcely the point it is what his majesty thinks that counts	but your majesty 
that will do herr mozart	just let me tell you how it begins
mozart herr mozart may i have a word with you please right away	certainly herr director
did you not know that his majesty has expressly forbidden ballet in his operas	yes but this is not a ballet this is a dance at figaros wedding
what are you doing herr director	taking out what you should never have put in
can we see the scene with the music back please	oh yes certainly certainly herr director
what is this herr chamberlain	what is what
why do i have to submit samples of my work to some stupid committee just to teach a sixteenyearold girl	because his majesty wishes it
is the emperor angry with me	on the contrary
then why doesnt he simply appoint me to the post	mozart you are not the only composer in vienna
no but im the best	a little modesty would suit you better
who is on this committee	kapellmeister bonno count orsini rosenberg and court composer salieri
naturally the italians of course always the italians	mozart 
they hate my music it terrifies them the only sound italians understand is banality tonic and dominant tonic and dominant from here to resurrection  baba baba baba baba anything else is morbid	mozart 
show them one interesting modulation and they faint ohime morbidezza morbidezza italians are musical idiots and you want them to judge my music	look young man the issue is simple if you want this post you must submit your stuff in the same way as all your colleagues
herr mozart 	may i just do that majesty show you how it begins just that
i dont think it was really decided director	oh german german please let it be german
my dear fellow the language is not finally the point do you really think that subject is quite appropriate for a national theatre	why not its charming i mean i dont actually show concubines exposing their their its not indecent  its highly moral majesty its full of proper german virtues i swear it absolutely
mozart 	sire only opera can do this in a play if more than one person speaks at the same time its just noise no one can understand a word but with music with music you can have twenty individuals all talking at once and its not noise  its a perfect harmony isnt that marvelous
mozart music is not the issue here no one doubts your talent it is your judgment of literature thats in question even with the politics taken out this thing would still remain a vulgar farce why waste your spirit on such rubbish  surely you can choose more elevated themes	elevated what does that mean elevated the only thing a man should elevate is  oh excuse me im sorry im stupid but i am fed up to the teeth with elevated things old dead legends how can we go on forever writing about gods and legends
about what	you tried to take your life you do remember that dont you
what do you want	do you understand that you have sinned gravely
are they	offer me your confession i can offer you gods forgiveness
i do not seek forgiveness	my son there is something dreadful on your soul unburden it to me im here only for you please talk to me
how well are you trained in music	i know a little i studied it in my youth
well	i regret it is not too familiar
oh i know that thats charming  i didnt know you wrote that	i didnt that was mozart wolfgang amadeus mozart you know who that is
of course the man you accuse yourself of killing	ah  youve heard that
all vienna has heard that	and do they believe it
is it true	do you believe it
do you hear me	he was murdered father mozart cruelly murdered
it was incomprehensible what was god up to here i was denying all my natural lust in order to deserve gods gift and there was mozart indulging his in all directions  even though engaged to be married  and no rebuke at all was it possible i was being tested was god expecting me to offer forgiveness in the face of every offense no matter how painful that was very possible all the same why him why use mozart to teach me lessons in humility my heart was filling up with such hatred for that little man for the first time in my life i began to know really violent thoughts i couldnt stop them	did you try
yes father yes so much for my vow of chastity what did it matter good patient hardworking chaste  what did it matter had goodness made me a good composer i realized it absolutely then  that moment goodness is nothing in the furnace of art and i was nothing to god	you cannot say that
no was mozart a good man	gods ways are not yours and you are not here to question him offer him the salt of penitence he will give you back the bread of eternal life he is all merciful that is all you need to know
all i ever wanted was to sing to him thats his doing isnt it he gave me that longing  then made me mute why tell me that if he didnt want me to serve him with music why implant the desire like a lust in my body then deny me the talent go on tell me speak for him	my son no one can speak for god
oh i thought you did so every day so speak now answer me	i do not claim to unravel the mysteries i treasure them as you should
what	his funeral  imagine it the cathedral all vienna sitting there his coffin mozarts little coffin in the middle and suddenly in that silence music a divine music bursts out over them all a great mass of death requiem mass for wolfgang mozart composed by his devoted friend antonio salieri what sublimity what depth what passion in the music salieri has been touched by god at last and god forced to listen powerless  powerless to stop it i at the end for once laughing at him do you understand do you
yes	the only thing that worried me was the actual killing how does one do that how does one kill a man its one thing to dream about it its very different when you have to do it with your own hands
no you didnt	i poisoned his life
my son why should you want all vienna to believe you a murderer is that your penance is it	no father from now on no one will be able to speak of mozart without thinking of me whenever they say mozart with love theyll have to say salieri with loathing and thats my immortality  at last our names will  be tied together for eternity  his in fame and mine in infamy at least its better than the total oblivion hed planned for me your merciful god
oh my son my poor son	dont pity me pity yourself you serve a wicked god he killed mozart not i took him snatched him away without pity he destroyed his beloved rather than let a mediocrity like me get the smallest share in his glory he doesnt care understand that god cares nothing for the man he denies and nothing either for the man he uses he broke mozart in half when hed finished with him and threw him away like an old worn out flute
ive just learned something that might be of interest to you herr director	yes
mozart is writing a new opera an italian opera	italian
you mean that play	exactly
hes setting that play to music	yes
are you absolutely sure	ive seen the manuscript
where	never mind
well mozart is already rehearsing	incredible
what anger	about the ballet
ballet what ballet	excuse me  didnt his majesty specifically forbid ballet in his opera
yes absolutely is there a ballet in figaro	yes in the third act
well actually sire if you remember we did finally incline to italian	did we
i know we banned this play but frankly i cant remember why can you refresh my memory herr director	for the same reason herr chamberlain that it was banned in france
oh yes yes and that was	well the play makes a hero out of a valet he outwits his noble master and exposes him as a lecher do you see the implications this would be in a grander situation as if a chamberlain were to expose an emperor
here i am my angel	what who the devil are you
ive taken pity on you my angel i heard your wish	oh well thank you how wonderful some people get all the luck
now youve got to promise me faithfully youll remain true to me forever then youll see how tenderly your little birdie will love you	i cant wait
well promise then	what do you mean  now
well i dont know i mean youre a delicious delightful delectable little bird but dont you think you might be just a little tough	oh im tender enough for you my boy im tender enough for you
this is embarrassing you know you introduced mozart to some of my friends and hes begging from practically all of them it has to stop	i agree baron
cant you think of anyone who might commission some work from him ive done my best i got him to arrange some bach for my sunday concerts he got a fee  what i could afford cant you think of anyone who might do something for him	no baron no im afraid mozart is a lost cause he has managed to alienate practically the whole of vienna he is constantly drunk he never pays his debts i cant think of one person to whom i dare recommend him
how sad its tragic isnt it such a talent	indeed just a moment  as a matter of fact i think i do know someone who could commission a work from him a very appropriate person to do so yes
she didnt say but she says its urgent	excuse me my dear
herr salieri	yes i am looking after him
can we come in	well hes sleeping now better not
but hes all right	oh yes hes just exhausted he became dizzy thats all we should let him rest
and say everything went wonderfully a triumphdeluxe  say that tell him the audience shouted his name a hundred times	bene
ill call tomorrow	yes  and congratulations to all of you it was superb
has the patient in twentyone gotten his tray yet	the american yes duck
you know did he seem depressed do you think hell eat the food	im an orderly not a bleeding psychiatrist i push things about but ive little say what happens to them
dr hirsch mr kessler cried out a minute ago	miss gallagher surely you must perform some function here at the hospital
can i be of service miss price	dr hirsch
go about your duties	yes doctor
oh miss price	yes doctor
what exactly did he call out	he said jack
that would be jack goodman the boy who was killed	what happened to them
did he say a wolf	yes i believe he did
its all right susan yes doctor i have	come to my office miss price
its a full moon where is he	at my flat im off at midnight and
hes not	alex has david persisted in his werewolf fantasies
david says jack comes to warn him	warn him
dr hirsch whats wrong is this more serious than i know	i tried to investigate the attack there are no records the case was closed and now theyve misplaced the file davids lacerations were cleaned and dressed when he arrived here and yet supposedly no doctor examined him before i did the goodman boy is already in the ground so hes no good to us so i went to the pub in east proctor where i was convinced of two things
youve absolutely no idea where david might be	no he knows no one in london besides me i shouldnt have left him alone
surely youre not suggesting	david has suffered a severe trauma i myself witnessed some form of mass neurosis in east proctor if all the villagers believe that jack goodman was killed by a werewolf why shouldnt david and then it follows that if he survived an attack by a werewolf wouldnt he himself become a werewolf the next full moon
dr hirsch	oh i dont mean running about on all fours and howling at the moon but in such a deranged state he could harm himself or perhaps others
what shall we do	lets call the police and see if they can help us find our wandering boy
hes here	is he all right why didnt you call me where was he
he doesnt remember he woke up at the zoo	the zoo is he rational
yes he is hes very excited and confused but hes not crazy if thats what you mean	have you read the papers today have you listened to the radio or television
no why	is david acting strangely
could you get here without any trouble	yes i should think so
right now listen carefully i want you to bring david here i want him in my care ill notify the police that weve found him it is imperative that you bring him straight to the hospital do you understand	yes doctor
youre certain hes lucid you wont need any help	hes fine well come right over
shall i send a car	no a cab will be faster
what shall we do	tea would be nice
nurse hobbs said theres a disturbance in leicester square involving some sort of mad dog	david

i should think so after your recent traumatic experiences	the guy i was with is he all right how did i get to london
miss price miss price please	get your fucking hands off me what the hell is going on here
how long have i been here	youve been unconscious since you were brought in two weeks ago
two weeks	youve suffered some rather severe cuts and bruises lost a bit of blood but nothing too serious black and blue for a while youll have some dueling scars to boast of that lunatic must have been a very fierce fellow they say a mad man has the strength of ten
lunatic	now weve just given you a pretty strong sedative so try to get some rest now miss price will see to your needs rest now
there were witnesses	so they said
how could there have been witnesses it was so dark we were running and i fell and jack went to help me up and this thing came from nowhere i dont understand what theyre talking about	in time im sure it will all come back to you
did you get a good look at the man who attacked you	ive told you it wasnt a man it was an animal a big wolf or something a rabid dog
yes	look dr hirsch i know ive been traumatized but jack was torn apart i saw him a man cant do that to someone with his bare hands
youd be surprised what horrors a man is capable of	did you see jack
no in fact your wounds were cleaned and dressed before you arrived here	did you talk to the police in east proctor did the cops go to the slaughtered lamb
i really dont know	then why the hell are you so quick to disbelieve me you yourself said it must have taken incredible strength to tear apart a person like that
david please the police are satisfied im certain that if a monster were out roaming northern england wed have seen it on the telly	you really think im crazy dont you
are you cold	yes
jack	david
youre not having a good time are you	oh i dont know i mean look around isnt this a fun place
well i like it here	im sorry northern england first italy later
debbie is not mediocre and she has one of the great bodies of all time	shes a jerk
youre talking about the woman i love	im talking about a girl you want to fuck so give me a break
well anyway do you think shell be there	i dont know
rendezvous in rome starring jack goodman and debbie klein the love affair that shocked europe see torrid lovemaking at its most explicit see jack and debbie expose their lust in the sacred halls of the vatican never has the screen dared	if you dont stop im going to kill you
i have to make love to her its very simple she has no choice really	it just fascinates me that you can spend so much energy on someone so dull
it is impossible for a body like that to be dull	weve known debbie what since the eighth grade how many years of foreplay is that
the slaughtered lamb	of course the slaughtered lamb why else would they have a severed fox head on a spear as their symbol
thats a wolfs head	of course the slaughtered lamb why else would they have a severed wolfs head on a spear as their symbol
thats not a spear its a pike	a severed wolfs head on a pike as their symbol
okay	shall we
hello	nice to see you
nice looking group	listen at least its warm in here
what about it	its a fivepointed star
ask them what the candles are for	you ask them
listen thats a pentangle a five pointed star its used in witchcraft lon chaney jr and universal studios maintain its the mark of the wolf man	i see you want me to ask these people if theyre burning candles to ward off monsters
right	wrong
jack wed better go	what do you mean im starving
come on jack shall we go	apparently so
what the hell was that all about	i dont know lets see if theres an inn or something up the road
beware the moon	come on im freezing
that was weird i guess leaving was the best idea	i dont know now that were out here and its three degrees im not so sure i wouldnt rather face a bloodthirsty mob
what do you think was wrong	i have no idea
maybe that pentangle was for something supernatural	i see and they were too embarrassed to talk about it because they felt so silly
did you hear that	i heard that
a coyote	there arent any coyotes in england
the hound of the baskervilles	pecos bill
heathcliffe	heathcliffe didnt howl
no but he was on the moors	its a full moon beware the moon
i vote we go back to the slaughtered lamb	yeah

im sorry to be upsetting you david but i had to come	arent you supposed to be buried in new york someplace
yeah your parents came to my funeral i was surprised at how many people came	why should you be surprised you were a very wellliked person
debbie klein cried a lot	i cant stand it
im going completely crazy	david

if you love me so much jack youll realize how disconcerting it is to share ones breakfast with the living dead	we were attacked by a werewolf
im not listening	on the moors we were attacked by a lycanthrope a werewolf
shut up you zombie	i was murdered an unnatural death and now i walk the earth in limbo until the werewolfs curse is lifted

hi jack	hi david
what can i say jack	you dont have to say anything
arent you going to say i told you so	if i was still alive i probably would
you look awful	thank you
i didnt mean it i dont know what im saying im not even sure it was me who killed those people i dont remember doing it	what about the zoo
david kessler this is gerald bringsly	hello
i could hang myself	if you did it wrong it would be painful youd choke to death
dr hirsch	come in come in please sit some tea
no thank you doctor	well then what can i do for scotland yard
you were saying	has david kessler anything to say concerning the attack on the moors
the forensic lads seem to feel that some sort of animal was involved thats true but i hardly think	regardless of what you think lieutenant the fact remains that david is missing and that we must find him
what can we do to assist you	stay here if we need you well know where to reach you
yes	lt villiers and sgt mcmanus are here to see you doctor
excuse me  yes	roger mathison doctor
what here	hes on the telephone
hello there what can i get you	campari and soda would do nicely
sorry love	i suppose guinness will suffice
whats that	oh thats been there for two hundred years we were going to paint it out but its traditional so we left it
hot chocolate	weve got spirits and beer if its something hot you want you can have tea
then you have some hot tea	no
oh	but i can heat some up for you if youd like
remember the alamo	i beg your pardon
no thank you	id like some tea please
sorry	has mr kessler said anything regarding the attack on the moors
he may have a point lieutenant two strong boys would be able to defend themselves against one man	sgt mcmanus are you suggesting that david and jack were in fact attacked by some animal and that the officialdom of east proctor has conspired to keep it a secret we have an autopsy report on the murderer who was shot in the act by the local police we have two witnesses to the crime youll forgive me mr kessler if i consider your testimony as coming from someone who has gone through a terrible shock
lieutenant the boy seems pretty lucid to me and	and what sergeant
i dont rightly know sir	that is precisely my point david as far as we are concerned the matter is closed we wont trouble you any further good day
i cannot accept a connection between david kessler and last nights murders we will find him however i can assure you of that	well find him not to worry
tom i never had trouble getting credit from you before when i was flat broke you gave me all the money i wanted now i come to you with a swell deal and the greatest	ill tell you why i dont like the crowd youre mixed up with  personally you can have all the credit you want but for that deal  not a cent
oscar whats the matter	i was the first one to see it i was coming down the stairs and there was the watchman lying dead at my feet
no kidding	no kidding when i saw it you coulda knocked me over with a pin
wheres matt	matt
yeah hell have a tough time thinking up a wisecrack for this one   	the detectives got matt up there in sampsons office
he has	yeah
say matt ill have to have some money for those manville payrolls	how much
about twentyfour thousand	it was more than that last week
yeah	heres twentyfive thousand
charlie	yeah
say pal did you ever hear of a depression	aw nerts
where you been	where do you think ive been  i took the baby for a stroll in the park
whats the matter charlie	im fourteen cents out and it took me half an hour to find the mistake and me with a date too
mr dickson in yet	not yet mr clark
and tell him not to delay	yes sir
dont make me laugh schultz	dickson doesnt have to go but he must agree to this merger with new york trust
what good will that do	what good will that do  why it will take control away from him well put somebody else in charge call in all doubtful loans and be on safe ground again thats what good it will do
you know dickson as well as we do hell shut the doors before he gives up control	all right let him im sick and tired of hearing about him if he wants to run the bank let him do it i dont want any part of it
say you know i found out something yesterday about hitting a golf ball youve got to hit with the left hand and from the inside out its the only way you can hit anything	i think mr dickson we would like to have a little of your very valuable time here at the bank this morning if you dont mind
whats the matter with my policy how many losses has this bank taken in the last twentyfive years  ill tell you not a single one  whats wrong with that kind of banking	just pure luck
most of the creditors i know personally ive seen them grow up in the community i knew their fathers and mothers before them	i know dickson thats all very well but youre taking too many chances in these times a bank should keep liquid in case of trouble in case of emergency
im running this bank my way get that clear	gentlemen you notice mr dickson refuses to consider our wishes he refuses an offer to merge with the new york trust  the only thing that will put this bank on safe ground he insists upon running a bank on so flimsy a thing as    as faith
we want to talk to you	what about
well be forced to shut the doors ive worked twentyfive years night and day to keep this bank alive youve all made money out of it are you willing to help	what do you mean help
i know that among you you have at least a million dollars in various banks throughout the city get that money over here and ill stop this run within five minutes	that sounds very simple dickson but why should we jeopardize our personal fortunes
the depositors you were protecting were the first ones to pounce on you you thought they were your friends why dont you go out there now and try and get some help from them	aw theyve gone crazy you cant reason with a mob
no you cant reason with anyone else when youre in a jam we pleaded with you to keep liquid but you wouldnt listen to us you preached to us about faith and a lot of other rubbish now you want our help you want us to throw a lot of cash into a bank that youve wrecked all right theres one way you can get it give us an option on your stock and resign as president	so thats it eh youve waited a long time for this chance havent you  well im not going to resign now  or ever
say you cant do that	i cant you just wait and see if that run doesnt stop within the next hour ill shut the doors you know what that means the bank examiner will step in tomorrow youll be forced to liquidate ill insist upon it the depositors will be paid one hundred cents on the dollar whats left you gentlemen can have but ill guarantee there wont be enough to pay your next months garage bill
dickson id like to talk to you about the bank	the bank all right do anything you want with it
come out here you pawnbrokers  take a look at this	weve been waiting fifteen minutes
i hope you dont mind me asking you a few questions mr cluett	of course yes just what would you like to know inspector
that is simple isnt it i assume you can prove that if necessary	oh yes of course there was someone with me a lady
oh	you understand
thanks	somebody must be in good humor he was humming mother machree
stand back inspector or ill shoot drop that gun	all right jack all right
dont be a fool cluett this is only going to make it worse for you	stand back inspector let me out of here or ill shoot you

uhh yeah it does	you stay out of this bob
no jimmy has a point the youngerjames gang could be confusing	how
this is the best score yet	its still taking too long the people used to snap to
that was because of the reputation the gang had	as long as people think jesses still riding we will never get the respect we deserve
i aint done 	what have you done
bob i didnt	swear
i swear 	swear on jimmys grave
im sorry cole	youre just upset about jesse we all are

cole i want to get to the farm make sure little jim and the girls are okay	stop by our spread after that tell our ma were all right well go to doc mimms

how many of them did he kill	two
you have no shame	not yet but im hoping

the outlaws calling themselves the jamesyounger gang shot their way out of town wounding the sherriff and three other townsfolk	hey
okay folks i think we know how this is going to go	one false move and ill blow your heads off
this is about the wanted posters isnt it	yes i am obviously not standing out in peoples minds at the robberies
the things a fella has to do to get a little respect around here	you are a fine figure of a man
listen jesse weve got a problem  its cole	hes been full of vinegar lately

thanks for the help	after all you did on our farm  you miss it dont you jesse
the war what are you crazy  there are things i miss about it	it was exciting
because we were good at it  hell we were great at it jesse dont tell anyone i said this because everybody knows im the toughest man in this town but you are one terrifying sonofabitch with those guns	yeah
this isnt a feud this is war theyve got more men than we do we kill detectives they can replace em in a day	so what do we do general lee
ill pick the first job i mean i know a girl down at the bank see if she cant get a list of towns where the railroad keeps its money	perfect cole
i got seven thousand	i got three
see franks being smart about this	just because he reads all those books and knows all those big words doesnt make him smart
its not a bank	its better its a construction depot theyll have the strongbox and some ammo and explosives for us to take that way we can take on a bigger job
the fidelity bank and trust was robbed on tuesday by a gang of twenty heavily armed men	twenty
jesse we got to have a word	sure cousin
all the posters and newspapers are calling this bunch the jamesyounger gang	yep
this is your fault for hogging all the publicity	hold on hold on we all know bob is an important part of the gang
itll be the biggest score yet	what will be
smells funny it being mentioned in the paper	if youd read about it first youd have no problems
beautiful	now the one time one of us comes up with an idea 
a bad idea	i got us through the war all right
and almost got hanged in peacetime	thats it
im the better soldier jesse	and im the better outlaw
still smells fishy	then let me run the show general lee
dammit	a trap
okay youre gonna rest here	clell tom go get doc mimms in liberty
well make them pay for this	im out
missed you cousin	missed you too cousin
you know you gettin caught right after leaving us some people thought 	pff all we been through the thought never crossed my mind

some indian tracker you turned out to be tom	you pay me to find you bluecoats there they are
waitll we get back to missouri start telling those gals about how little jesse james charged the whole union army by himself	you ride like a comanche
tom why dont you stop at our spread before you head on out to the reservation figure we might have some work for you if you want	hmm go back to the reservation and get drunk in a dirt shack or work for you
well	im thinking
cannon or gatling	both would be nice
i think one of ems glass	which one right or left
oh lord the dance hall girl at buntys	sadie was not a man
i have no idea what you just said but it sounded real nice	shakespeare  hes european
bastards come back here and face me	get buckets
hey we decide something thats it were in this for the long haul and this idea of me and jesses will help give us more places to hide out without worrying about some farmer with a shotgun sneakin up on us in our sleep weve got to think 	strategically
jesse	oh youre in charge we aint partners any more jesse you tell cole younger where and when to ride
another dozen out back	they gonna rush us
what	where is jesse james
open the damn safe	all right all right  jesse james never yelled at folk

of st louis	hoyah him say tell big lawman in carville that badman jesse james riding toward rising sun above great river near eagle rock
go ahead to the saloon but dont get too drunk	me get heap firewater 
then why cant i go in there	on account of were robbing it
oh why didnt you just say so	its a secret
fine ill just wait here	id appreciate that
old man tucker is just standing quiet outside the bank	so
where the hell were you	i had you covered  from back there
 rode right into them screaming like a banshee	my little web did that
web died fighting	died a hero
boys	go home doc  they aint gonna hang no more liberty boys
you know youre welcome any time	yesss but i was thinking i could come by and then take zee out some place near with other folk near here  but out
daddy dont start with this again	zerelda its no coincidence the railroad men come through offering to buy up land nobody sells then they start hanging men who own farms for treason
hes going to be fine right daddy	the bullet came out clean but he lost a whole lot of blood praying wouldnt hurt
theyre gone what are you 	i fooled them into thinking i was alone
well i hope the boy pulls through we should know in the morning	i think hes already feeling better
he thinks this is some kind of game	im upset too zee but jesse and cole know what theyre doing im sure they wont press their luck
every time i put my head up to hit that gatling they try to shoot it off	so we got a plan
so youre saying i could have done more to attract their attention	mmhmm
such as	you could have worn one of those big floppy womans easter sunday hats
that would have made an impression	i figure
see thats your problem frank by the time you finish figuring out stuff im already finished doing it	no jesse your problem is youre always doing stuff before im finished figuring it out
hell of a war	im sure it seemed like a good idea at the time
hello liberty missoura	all this time in the saddle we get to the farm im going to shoot this damn horse just on principle
looks like web mimms wasnt the only casualty this towns got	we better go to docs see whats going on here
frank dont you have something to say	youre doing just fine
whyyyy he took down the gatling gun and the cannon all by himself	saved all our lives doc none of the liberty boys would have come home if not for web mimms doc gods honest truth
big and older	you can shut up now
you are a charmer	i swear ill shoot you in your sleep
shes still talking to jesus	what worries me is that jesus is talking back
 if you stop saying things about my zee	your zee hmm  from womens eyes this doctrine i derive they sparkle still the right promethean fire they are the books the arts the academes that show contain and nourish all the world
you know him	heard of him
i went up to the courthouse and looked at the right of way documents for the rail bed the railroad doesnt even need our land theyre just taking the land on both sides for as far as they can	damn all that reading paid off
you ready to stop loafing around with this young lady and get back to farming	what do you think
youre looking a bit more spry now that somebody 	shut up  uh doc i was wondering if uh this evening i could come by
pinkertons its the railroad	ma
 we could move on rebuild make a decent life someplace else	dont care
didnt think you would  im going to go make the coffin	make a thousand of em still wont be enough by the time im through
and i planned getting you off the hangmans deck 	and thats why you both lead the gang two of you went into that bank together right
and its guarded by pinkerton detectives	and i do so want to shoot some pinkerton detectives
i dont think its counterfeit do you mind if i take a look at all your real bills to compare	its the scientific method its all the rage
gents we are in the middle of something here	bobs upset
pardon the delay folks but we had to get mad bob younger under control	bob herell kill a man for sneezing and hes the best shot in the gang
this has been a good year	jesse were outlaws
and were good at it	it got to you didnt it all the killing in the war you need it now
youve killed your fair share of men	if i could go back to farming 
thats a lie you couldve bought a dozen farms with the money weve stolen	i cant quit and leave you alone i cant quit until you quit ma wouldve wanted it that way
what do you want me to say frank i was killing men when i was fifteen i like getting shot at i like riding out of town with a posse at my back this is a helluva better life than farming	a better life than the one you could have had with zee
were drunk	oh yeah
you taking sides against me now frank	no i 
theyre all pinned down cant even get to the door	got any ideas little brother
shoulda learned with web made it look fun made it look like an adventure got web killed now jim	jim was old enough
he was a boy riding with the most famous outlaws in the west how was he supposed to say no to that	railroad burned him out too you couldnt have stopped him
a war against the railroad what the hell were we thinking	im sure it seemed like a good idea at the time
ill meet you down there in a few weeks	see you soon oh and i appreciate the distraction back there
yknow uncle frank	yeah jimmy
every time you tell that story you stop there thats not how it ended i was five when my dad got shot	i know but thats how it should have ended your dad and mom riding off into a new life growing old together happy
that he was	theyre making him a hero now
saved a lot of folk from the railroad	but he killed a lot of men too
cant argue that	so what was he
uncle frank	yeah jimmy
how much of that story is true	everything but the boring parts
did you kill yankees	a fair number ma
ma im glad to see you being nice to our injun friend	hes a good christian and he killed yankees jesus told me that made him an all right boy
easterners	were just fine thank you sir
doc mimms will 	shush
zerelda little zee mimms	you were little jesse james when you left
but still died	if theres anything we can do for you dr mimms we want to help
jesse is that your hand	nuhhuh 
you shouldnt be up	ive been on my back two weeks im sick of it
youre sick of my company	no i mean of course not no
teasing you is completely unfair	what you do to me is unfair the teasing i mean
i shouldnt tease a hero	what
everybody in the county knows it was you who rescued cole were all so proud of you jesse and not a single farms been sold to the railroad since youre everybodys hero	i wasnt the only one risking my neck that day
so youre saying i should leave you alone and go spend time with jimmy younger	unfair you are completely unfair
i used to come to this tree when i was a kid and imagine what my life would be like when i got older	you didnt want to farm
i was thinking more along the lines of being a river pirate	a river pirate
arr hand over your jewels missy	thank god you grew out of that  you did grow out of that didnt you
mostly it would be an all right life for a bachelor	you planning on being a bachelor your whole life jesse james
not if i find the right girl	and whats this right girl like
smart funny bossy always makes me think shes two steps ahead of me and big buck teeth	where will you find such a girl
little ones	is this one of franks shakespeare poems youre trying to quote
yep	were you planning on kissing me when you finished quoting
i am so sorry jesse	frank and me have to go away for a while
whose justice yours or gods  when will you stop	when my name makes them cry in their sleep when ive brought them to ashes
zee	jesse what are you thinking there are bounty hunters and lawmen all over this county
i dont understand	shes the most wonderful woman in the world cant get her out of my mind
thats wonderful its just i thought	shes beautiful smart and has the biggest buck teeth in all of missouri
i would never have imagined us in a place like this	thats why i picked it we can start a whole new life down here
are you going to be happy here mr james without all that excitement	ive got you you keep me busy i figure well get over to the hotel get checked in cleaned up then id like to do something ive been thinking about for a long time
hmm	hmm what
aw shucks maam	stop it this is just sad
dont turn around	what
you get arrested again ill kill you	yes maam
i cant believe i had to blow up a train for you	you are a hell of a woman
dont swear	yes maam
were moving you tomorrow	but i like the presidential suite
oh its a similar room but the hotel is in washington dc youre not going to get a fair trial down here in front of a jury of jesse james sympathizers	so ill get a fair trial in front of a jury bought off by thaddeus rains
did you order our houses burned down	not that day i am guilty of many things but that was mr thaddeus rains and parker that day
you almost ended my career before it began	pity
how did you spot the ambush in torrell	last february
mmm	you had all those cattle there so id think the extra men were in town from the cattle drive
yes	the cows had a brand from a farm just five miles out of town
almost got me in billings i saw you there shooting at me	i went myself to oversee the operation didnt help much
oh thats nice to know  were going to hang you you know	i figured
was it worth it	should have just killed thaddeus rains and been done with it
thats what i would have done	im not hanged yet
you cocky little bastard	ahh youll miss me
that was for my ma now this is for everybody else	hes too important james  theyll set the army on you you and your wife
the railroad has no business in tennessee therefore i have no interest in the state of tennessee	thanks
id just as soon kill you jesse james but chasing you takes up too much of my time	fair enough
this is unusual most of our marriages are members of the congregation	you dont think godll mind do you
the lord is remarkably tolerant of the charitable  jesse woodson james jesse james the jesse james	i could have lied i suppose but i want this marriage to be legal i just want you to know im trying to start a new life here im depending on your
discretion sir i am a man of the cloth	thank you
now lets have a drink	right here in church
and youre too young	im the same age you were when you went off to war
i like that	no
you okay jesse	yeah hey are you drinking whisky youre too young to be drinking whisky
not too young to shoot a man not to young to drink	i guess so
jim you been with a girl yet	tonight why im just getting ready to turn on the younger charm
well not exactly	you been with a girl ever
you and frank and cole and even bob get all these girls because youre good looking and famous you dont have to pay they just look at me like im the baby brother  dont tell anyone okay jesse	i swear
tell you something else  i cant drink that good neither im going to go outside and throw up	you do that
what about that rock island bastard	its his money  hes putting up the payroll out of his own fortune you do want to hurt thaddeus rains dont you jesse
 too young for whisky	this time well make an exception
why yeah	i hope you dont mind jesse james told me your name
oh you were talking to jesse	yes but just so i could find out who you were
really	i hope im not being too forward
not at all	i just though you were awful cute
gosh thats a pretty name buy you a drink	could we go upstairs and talk its so loud down here
devereux my brother cole dated a european girl once	really
well this land is about to be condemned	im doing you folks a favor 
relax alan the army has this all in hand and mr thaddeus rains will be very pleased with this news nothing like a hanging to motivate the populace to relocate	its not my job to relax ive put men facing out both ways down main street so nobody can ride in shooting ive got a sharpshooter up on the water tower just in case
how can that be	they donate money to farmers to churches rumor has it they gave the sharecroppers of maddox so much money they were able to build a school
theres only four of them	move you fools
mr thaddeus rains sir it is a pleasure to have you join us in the field	and it is my pleasure to be here
really	no it is not my pleasure to have to leave my board room to come to this godforsaken piece of dirt to discover why in the name of all that is holy you cannot seem to evict a few simple farmers from their pathetic little mudholes so that i may build the greatest railroad that this country has ever seen
good	unfortunately not sir a gang of local thugs managed to rescue him from the gallows not only has this inspired resistance from the other farmers the redoubtable mr alan pinkerton was seriously injured during the incident
leaving you in charge of operations until he recovers	yes sir
you see the army leaving and you see the loss of a tool i see a power void to be filled as we have the most power we may move with impunity	i see ill get together four patrols of our detectives for action tonight
they exchanged fire with the pinkerton guards killing several of them then they raided the payroll office and blew the tracks for half a mile	how much did they get from the safe
thirtyfive thousand sir coins and currency and the delay from the miles of destroyed track 	ill kill them for blowing up my railway
to be precise they didnt blow up the tracks	then who did
your men knew the risks	what is going on here man
with my money	we should go burn that school to the ground sir
the final route for the railroad is complete	i look forward to seeing it
parker	sir
what is that	what sir
that	oh that ill let jenkins explain
this is him	i remember you
how did you know	not such a menace now is he pinkerton
this is no game	im afraid our adversaries dont agree
a rock island and pacific railroad depot was robbed two nights ago just outside st louis missouri the brave and daring jamesyounger gang was heavily outnumbered by pinkerton detectives but the city lawmen were no match for the guns of the west	it is a nice piece of writing
the gang made off with thirtyfive thousand dollars and also destroyed the thaxton switch construction meaning that for a few months honest farmers will be able to sleep without fearing the railroad is coming to steal their land  who wrote this ill see him hanged every tuesday for a month	oh thats the best part
its early in the game yet mr rains jesse james and i are just learning how each other moves feeling out each others patterns	im losing millions of dollars and months of time while you play chess with these farmers
hardly farmers ive done some checking all these were in the war these men know sabotage tactics and have four years of bloody fighting experience behind them they are disciplined welltrained and have a charismatic leader if i were to design the perfect outlaw band this gang is what i would create	so you cant tell me anything
first of all you shut up  now youve given me a thousand miles of railroad to cover every time the james gang strikes we shift a hundred detectives to that area but theres just too much open land too many riverbeds to ride caves to hide in this gang operates across four states often riding a hundred miles between jobs	i cant believe this
yes thats the way to win the locals back to our side	i demand action
no you demand results they are not the same thing and if you want results you will let me do my job as i see fit unless of course  you want this fool to saddle up and take another run at it	cant you tell me anything
so hes won	no
every three months the james gang circles back to the vicinity of liberty missouri they always pull a job right before they return probably to have extra money to give family and friends	in english pinkerton
no need i have another tool at my disposal which will narrow it down to one bank	what is that
what the hell is that sound	vengeance
listen what are you doing tonight	what oh imbusy
listen youre dating luis hes in arizona youre fucking me and we havent made plans what could you possibly be up to tonight	stop it im

anything else you can tell me about owen	we were both seven in 1969
his girlfriend doesnt think so	buthas anyone seen him in london
actually yes	hmmm
was he involved at all  do you think in occultism or satan worship	what
i know it sounds like a lame question but in new jersey i know this sounds like a lame question but last monthi dont know if youve heard about this but a young stockbroker was recently arrested and charged with murdering a young chicano girl and performing voodoo rituals with various body parts	yikes no paul wasnt into that he followed a balanced diet and
had his apartment been burglarized	no it actually hadnt toiletries were missing a suit was gone so was some luggage thats it
i mean no ones dealing with the homicide squad yet or anything right	no not yet as i said were not sure but basically no one has seen or heard anything
nothing	people justdisappear
the earth just opens up and swallows people 	eerie really eerie
youll have to excuse me i have a lunch meeting with cliff huxtable at four seasons in twenty minutes	isnt the four seasons a little far uptown i mean arent you going to be late
listen if anything occurs to you any information at all	absolutely im 100 with you
soyou hang out here a lot	uh yesi meanwhenever necessary you know
hows the investigation going taken anyone in for formal questioning 	0h no informal conversations mostly whats that stoli
yeah no finlandia as usual fucking dump	too true you know batemanpeople tend to reveal so much more about themselves when theyre in a relaxed setting dont you think
i mean they want to get caught	dan great to see you again like i said you need anything at all im your man i dont envy your job i mean owen was acomplex man
i actually came to see timothy price but hes taken a leave of absence	yeah gone into rehab shame  is he a suspect
do you remember where you were on the night of pauls disappearance  which was on the twentieth of december	godi guessi was probably returning videotapes
i had a date with a girl named veronica	wait thats not what ive got
what	thats not the information ive received
well i could he wrong	wellwhen was the last time you were with paul owen
well thank you mr bateman	patrick please i hope ive been informative long daya bit scattered
never i meani dont really like singers	not a big music fan eh
no i like music justtheyrehueys too black sounding for me	well to each his own solunch thursday ill call your secretary about reservations
no hash browns	not in the mood i guess
so the night he disappeared any new thoughts on what you did	im not really sure i had a showerand some sorbet
i think maybe youve got your dates mixed up	but how where do you place paul that night
according to his date book and this was verified by his secretary he had dinner withmarcus halberstam	and
ive questioned him	marcus
yes	well does marcus have an alibi
oh kimball now where were you 	where was marcus
he wasnt with paul owen	so who was he with
im so hungry	its cold out too isnt it
im so hungry	why dont you get a job if youre so hungry why dont you get a job
gee uh thats too bad	im so hungry
youre not what qualified for anything else	im hungry
listen do you think its fair to take money from people who do have jobs from people who do work	what am i gonna do
speak up come on	al
get a goddamn job al youve got a negative attitude thats whats stopping you youve got to get your act together ill help you	you re so kind mister youre kind youre a kind man i can tell
shhhhits okay	pleasei don know what to do im so cold
do you know how bad you smell the stench my god	i canti cant find a shelter
hello halberstam nice tie how the hell are you	ive been great and you
really thats interesting  not great	oh well you know
and hows cecilia shes a great girl	oh yes im very lucky
listen the mud soup and the charcoal arugula are outrageous here	yeah well youre late
hey im a child of divorce give me a break  hmmm i see theyve omitted the pork loin with lime jello	we shouldve gone to dorsia i couldve gotten us a table
and cecelia how is she where is she tonight	cecelia is wellyou know 
evelyn great ass goes out with that loser patrick bateman what a dork	another martini paul
no man im gonna bail	come on you dumb son of a bitch  ive got a preview of the barneys catalogue and a bottle of absolut waiting for us
you like huey lewis and the news	theyre okay bateman their early work was a little too new wave for my taste but then sports came out in 1983 i think they really came into their own commercially and artistically
hey halberstam	yes owen
why are there copies of the style section all over the place do you have a dog a chow or something	no owen
is that a raincoat	yes it is
you think so	youll look like you consciously worked for the look
i just dont see how someone anyone can appear that way and yet be involved in such total shit how can you be so fucking i dont know cool about it	some guys are just born cool i guess
is it over	they still have to give em refreshments laced with mindaltering drugs
you are a fanatic	gonna wait outside
i cant help it i feel like theyd do anything to keep their 	anything thats not even credible if he wants to go up there to check it out i think you should encourage him  its his life but everybodys treating him like this  valuable object youre hurting your own case
i think i kind of lost it i was just so thrilled to be talking to the richest most powerful didnt know i even cared about that stuff	cmon how often do you talk to somebody whos been on the cover of time three of four times
a lot of what larry says is true they just clone stuff or reverse engineer it and everybody gets stuck with their inferior version cause they 	then youve gotta ask him about that
when i was a kid and he was moving us all over the place i spent all my time writing stuff on outpost 10 i thought gary boyd was the greatest	but hes not quite the same guy anymore dont get your hopes too high
if my dadd leveled with me like that even once the weird thing is my fantasy he could somehow be like the old gary its his fantasy too	i think thats great milo i do
i forgot thats why you have to help me decide	no way you have this  destiny
cmon i wouldnt have a destiny without you my destiny would be dying at 20 from eating 	dont bring that up like a different girlfriend woulddve let you die
whens brian coming for the tv	probly waiting by the phone for outpost to call well leave it for him
you know hes never been anybodys counselor before	milo what about 
to our new life  whats wrong	thats what i need to ask you  you know you cant keep anything from me
its the way he said it just the way my dad did when he was caught in a lie thats how you knew you were onto something ugly	what would it mean anyway if he didnt write it
hes your boss hes not your 	i know i know
if you cant deal with him on that basis you better get a new counselor	isnt that  extreme
what	teddy was killed last night
whatre you  what	it was a hate crime
are you saying you think they had something to do with his death nelson said it was an airtight case	i dont know what im saying maybe  maybe they hired those guys
i cant see outpost putting its reputation in the hands of people like that	i dont know i just know it was teddys code all these ideas flying in from everywhere you know how he says any kid working in his garage can put us out of business its like they know what every kids doing
they hack into peoples programs	nobody does work like this online its in your pc or in a mainframe selfcontained theyd have to be like watching people physically  oh jesus
it isnt a broadcast studio its  a surveillance post or something thats why they have the dishes on top	youre scaring me i think we should just go
go where you cant get away from people like this	like this its gary youre talking about
you think i dont know that	milo why would he 
how should i know solving a problem i guess or needing to control everything i dont know  ive gotta get in there	even if all this were true therere 20 other buildings all of them filled with computers and 
its the only one with dishes on the roof the studios a front thats why they keep postponing its opening  gotta get in there	milo you told me those doj agents are all over the place how could they hope to hide a surveillance post  and how can you get in there anyway with the cameras and the swipe cards 
i cant just walk away	you cant just walk in either
they stop the construction work at six or seven the parking lots mostly clear by two or three in the morning even the early geeks dont get there before five	is it two or is it three have you ever really noticed
its almost nine ive been so worried  what did you see in there	nothing
its what they said it is an unfinished broadcast studio you were right i just drove to seattle and back	why
after i broke into 21  which was insane thank god they didnt catch me  i just drove around trying to figure out what possessed me you know what ive been putting my own guilt on gary	guilt
if id stayed down there maybe this wouldntve happened	poor baby you know thats not true
that was  different	different
where were you  you know you cant keep anything from me	okay yeah i did something naughty theres this amazing comix store in seattle  to tell you the truth i did it once or twice at stanford guess i cant keep anything from you
look at this	what
why doesnt he ask us to his party hes never even met you	he has thousands of employees milo 
its for the museum he knows youre a painter if anybody should be invited 	milo 
i know you think im too attached to him but still i am close to gary and youre the most meaningful person in my life  im going back to the comix place why should i be killing myself	milo you 
are you gonna tell me where you went	i went to see the skywire model in garys office you know just to hold it again
no no i sent an email to somebody just now to tell her how i feel about you  you know im clueless without you you know i 	just shut up
great	look at me im gonna change
you look beautiful	yeah give me a goodbye kiss
what	i know you youre gonna run back to work right after dinner i want my kiss now
milo	dont we have any chopsticks
here we go	great
wanna savor this	its gonna get cold
right wait a toast	youre just afraid to eat it
didnt mention he was going to the justice department	no
not like him is it to do a thing like that without telling you youre not losing your hold on him are you	hell tell me when he gets home
lisas an extremely valuable member of the skywire team weve got our eyes on her you keep yours on milo	prick
he said it made sense that garys code was like teddys that that clich about great minds was true said it was all about his own guilt  plus he has a tendency to get gary mixedup with his dad once in a while it always passes	he wasnt acting
dont worry milo im here as a friend or maybe a supplicant	right whats that mean again
beggar were at a disadvantage with outpost our experts arent as smart as theirs sometimes we cant tell which technologies pose the threat of a monopoly we need a really smart guy to help us pick our fights im taking a shot in the dark here i can offer you 32000 a year a buick im hoping youve got a feeling its the right thing to do	its just  i kind of feel the need to do something with my ability create something
yes sir i need to talk to you	give me two seconds with lacy here  go on in i wont be a moment
milo	yeah hi thank you for seeing me
what seems to be the problem you look a little upset	i am i am sir
milo	my friend my best friend teddy was killed in silicon valley
if theres a civil rights violation but generally we let the local police and da do their work first	i  just wanna help bring these guys to justice theyre neonazis
let me look into it see whats being done frankly its not my area	just didnt know who else to talk to
and outpost youre happy there	yes sir
youre living here	thought if i relocated it could help my case im writing programs for the local public access station where any whackjob with 100 bucks gets his own show god does it suck  can you help me
what	whatd they ever do for you
okay	great great we need to drag a lot of heavy stuff in front of the door 
what	wanna be a part of history
youre interfaced with our dish	gimme the coordinates
is it your software	is it your dish
when did you know	you shouldve called a few times to bug me about your job prospects
thats gotta kill him right	outpost was his baby sure on the other hand we just learned gary boyd owns the skywire satellites personally
theres no hard evidence he knew about this anybody who could implicate him seems tove vanished	isnt there a stigma bankrolling this guy
stigma larry 60 billion buys you some slack in this world	and the kid who wrote skywire  then gave it away theyre calling him the digital robin hood
milo surprised hes not your guest	we tried
milo im danny	oh hi
couldnt convince teddy to come	hes pretty tight with his family
we could move em up here	he just likes to write code hes bummed theres so much secrecy and competition everybody trying to own everything
cool	would you like a coke or something
ive only shown this to three other people i bought 200 weve launched 12 so far i keep the coordinates in this room  its left over from sdi reagans star wars technology they orbit 426 miles up	low enough to relay internet traffic
among other things we know convergence is the real superhighway all the pcs tvs phones etc linked together why cram it into a cable if you can use the whole sky	skywire
the content filer has tbe written into the media files so bits coming off the satellite can be read by multiplatforms really omniplatforms including whatever new hardware emerges	it needs a more objectoriented language this doesnt scale does it
no just waiting for my counselor to come by and introduce himself	okay im gary
think i should buy some originals	do i
somebody said im just another philistine with reproductions	thats insane youre ahead of your time
could work with a new switch there may be a few more things hidden	dont spend too much time searching you ever vetted somebodys old code before  its a different skill stay close to the surface the besthidden secrets are in plain sight you know the best place to hide a leaf right  in a tree
its okay really	take a look at this slightly different approach
milo whats up	well  you sent for me
it scales dont you think	definitely
had you talked to him much lately	just once guess i was worried we didnt have anything to talk about since work was offlimits non disclosure
i meant did you find other stuff to 	oh yeah
youve been coming in early	it helps alice said it would help to focus on something  dont know what id do without her
gary hi	you look a little tired
im okay its going well	have a look
cause he was a liar and i hated him  get your head out of that machine wise up to the real world the more he mocked me the deeper i went cause if being savvy meant being like him   guess thats why im kind of clueless even now didnt cultivate my conniving side not sure i even have one	dont be so hard on yourself with a brain like yours you could connive with the best of em i bet
you couldve handwritten it	im not much good at handwriting or parties
i hope you know what you mean to me not just because of what youre doing because of who you are	i do know gary i feel the same way i thought i was coming here for a job but its meant a lot more
im pretty close but when i wrote the last contact switches it wiped out a piece of the content filer you know what its like writing software	i do know you focus on the big problem but somewhere down the chain something breaks down something gets destroyed at first its upsetting you feel youve lost control
this is good who did it	startup not 50 miles from here kids on prozac
whatd the girl say	there may be a little less trust after your outburst
help me change the skywire settings add five degrees to each satellite coordinate	gary dont worry we 
okay 2	longitude 48 degrees 06 minutes 
longitude 109 	wait he knows
what	knows im altering the coordinates lets jump to 12
all the companies know the faculties tell em at the target schools	in exchange for endowments they should just drop the pretense and name the schools after em
i think you should go	you do
its only meaningful when youve got 40000 lines of code to back it up	man could he write code totally elegant he had his own style
your app kind of blew mine out of the water	well come up with the next big thing
you wanna work  here	got out of my other commitment
you guysll be using teddys old space is that okay	cool
could it be a glitch something the construction workers caused	unlikely all 14 cameras are frozen do we call randy and phil tell em there may have been a breakin
every entry was authorized	keep looking
whatre we looking for	any irregularity in the pattern
delbert seems to enter 21 twice without leaving the first time	lets get him in here
get the backslash the colon keys kids dont use but geeks do  what would milo want in here anyway	they know just they dont trust me with it so well get the evidence first ask questions later
you calling phil and randy	im calling gary
come with me	where we going
lisa	you know my name
you know mine	youre famous around here
im getting a teachers pet rep	i wouldnt worry about it youve gotta figure most people around here were their teachers pets
were you	we moved around so much i barely knew my teachers
me too were you an army brat or something	something like that yeah
whatve you got there	graphical interfaces for skywire im sposed to coordinate with you
cool	yeah i ran it for lots of platforms ranging from the narrowest bandwidth to 
did you wanna be alone	no please
they just pushed up the schedule on skywire apps how fast are you going	there is no second place plus every time i get jammedup gary has an inspiration  is it like that with your counselor
maybe once i rewrote it anyway	youre compulsive
mmmmore like  i have a little trouble trusting people	whys that
so when you were talking about wishing people were more like computers was that then or now	then and now  but not right now
thats great i  didnt know	she saved my life
i snuck into 21	why would you do a thing like 
you thought about it too youve been suspicious for a while but its not happening in there its happening in the day care	the day care
its easy to know who the smart geeks are the schools tell em they upload medical files school records pharmacy files theyd be happy just to steal code forever but when a program gets close to fruition like teddy he was almost there	but why would they 
is that my  scenario  tell me	theyd frame him
hes out of prison	theyre already watching you if they had to theyd give him this drug that mimics an alcoholic blackout hed wake up not even remembering his act of revenge
what about the fbi	theyve got this guy in the doj maybe others we tell the wrong person its over
who can we trust	theres always a logical answer  you just have to define the question
do we post it on the net	therere so many disinformation sites about gary already where he has devils horns or they crop him in with saddam hussein
the mainstream media tv or a newsmagazine	right but garys tiedin to a lot of media conglomerates have to be careful who we pick
we could crossreference a data base on media ownership but not on our own computers not even at home	certainly not at my happy home
yeah they dig stuff like this  cbs news has partnered with outpost information systems in a cable news network due to launch fall of 2001	but still you cant say cbs wouldnt love to break something like 
time	timewarner has a 40 per cent stake in garys settop device that also takes out cnn  ge joins outpost in new venture which means nbc is out disney joins outpost abc is out outpost and newscorp in new deal fox is out any of these places could have a mole or all of em  its like a a continuous loop we can go to some alternative press place that 1000 people read get them and us killed but anything big enough for this is a parent of or a subsidiary to something garys got a finger in
how close are you	what
we cant just assume theyre standing by to receive skywire 12 months from launch id have to write in an aglet	a what
its how online services push logos they wanna sell you you dont ask for em they just appear have to work on it somewhere besides my office or my house and then the quality of the broadcast wouldnt exactly be digital thats 12 months away	but theyd still get the idea right
youd have to design a graphic interface to make the data pop maybe some audio too to tie it all in to gary how long would that take you	its a standard gui once ive got a concept its maybe three days work
gary knows im close on skywire we have to do this fast	before they kill somebody else too
oh man id have to get into garys house to get the satellite positions	you mean  break in
i dont know 	and what if the broadcast dishes on top of 21 arent hot yet you said the place isnt finished
why were you so careless	i thought the worst they would do is fire me who knew they took termination so literally
why were you snooping in my office	oh  i liked you i was checking you out
i told teddy about you	whatd he say
i felt guilty cause i owed so much to alice but even then i was starting to wonder is it so great to be so consumed by this one thing that you let another person do your thinking for you if you have a lucrative skill its all anybody wants from you you grow older but you dont grow up you turn into  into 	gary
great i knocked off the aglet as soon as i get a passable version of skywire were there	the dishes are juiced up too
they know i broke in alice helped me  shrots not one of them hes blundering into this on his own	he doesnt know about the day care
hardly anybody does thats the beauty part no cameras the doj doesnt bother with it its accessed by a tunnel they boast about you know the best place to hide a leaf	yeah thats old in a tree
oh	milo what if shrot notices somebody entered the day care at four am and tells them about it
same with the excerpts im choosing theyll play against any of the images you described	perfect  how am i gonna get away from the party long enough to 
you could always say you have to go the bathroom	thats lame isnt it
why	she called to apologize i said i was pulling an allnighter she said then come home just to say hi which i always do when we fight its suspicious if i dont
please dont go	at this point the worst thing i could do is anything out of the ordinary
they know i had no choice get out of the house now do you have a laptop	its three years old it 
bring it to the other location	but you said the other 
maybe its the satellite	lets try 2
he knows	what
you got my email	and your phone messages you wanna do what you do its not a crime
is that how larry feels	uh not exactly
wanted to say goodbye to him	hey we got seed money for the startup a millionfive
we rented a loft in sunnyvale  you know whats the bad part we cant talk about work anymore were competitors the venture capitalists made us sign like 100 confidentiality forms	outpost made me sign 1000 guess well find out what else we have to talk about life stuff
but these like white supremacists trashed my office last week	what
theyre in the neighborhood they usually hassle vietnamese grocers	jesus teddy
im cool they didnt touch the machine or my disks probably didnt know what they were so you a moonie yet  milo	i met this girl
what come on is it serious	i dont know
did you tell alice	no i keep thinking itll go away but theres this  connection shes been hacking since she was little she had to move around a lot plus i see her every day were working on the same program shes  beautiful
a beautiful geek i dont wanna sound paranoid or like a pig but whatre the chances	what dyou mean
i dunno i guess larrys got me totally suspicious of that place	what does that mean
milo geeks dont have two girlfriends most dont have one	i didnt plan this
every geek heres got a thing for lisa but thats about the biggest reaction shes had to anybody	shes a programmer
heavy graphical background doing designinterface for skywire apps  youll be working with her	ive got a girlfriend remember
whatre they building	21 way behind schedule its top secret but everybody knows its a digital broadcast space they see the dishes on top the fiber optics going in
garys not into fiber optics hes betting everything on the satellites	you wanna survive in the software business you cover your bets i gotta say this is the weirdest car anybody ever requested
did you download corey in san jose	damn have to go back over there  be so much easier if we could walk in the front door
what is it	not much glorified cherry bomb right by the civil defense sign some geeks idea of irony i been saying we need a camera in this hall
theres nothing in this hall someones pulling your chain as usual	unless its a diversion milos in my office he was tailgating so i 
that kids the great white hope	i could get it out of him
fellas im gonna have to ask you to leave here now	wait a second im the one who found out he was mucking around in here in the first place
what and watch all my earnings go  down the toilet	what do you want mr cunningham was it
call me ritchie miss fagina may i call you alotta  please	you may
your boss number two i understand that cats involved in big underground drills	virtucons main interest is in cable television but they do have a subterranean construction division yes how did you know
i didnt baby you just told me	its for the mining industry mr cunningham we can talk about business later but first let me slip into something more comfortable
come in	id rather talk about number two
may i wash you	groovy
in japan men come first and women come second	or sometimes not at all
care for some saki	saki it to me
how do you feel mr cunningham	mmmm i feel extreme relaxation
to my health	kiss me

hello exposition	austin vanessa let me bring you up to speed dr evil has high jacked a nuclear warhead from kreplachistan and is holding the world ransom for onehundred billion dollars if the world doesnt pay up in four days hes threatening to destroy the world
excuse me	whats the other thing youre scared of
carnies	what
circus folk  nomads you know they smell like cabbage	indeed if we could get back to the business at hand its one thing to have a warhead its quite another thing to have the missiles to launch it
maybe these photographs are the last piece of that puzzle  ive uncovered the details on project vulcan its a new subterranean warhead delivery system	good god and underground missile weve long feared such a development
my god austin what have you done	thats not your mother thats a man

dr evil do you really expect them to pay	no mr powers i expect them to die even after they pay me the money im still going to melt all the cities of the world with hot magma  all right guard begin the unnecessarily slowmoving dipping mechanism
ive got you dr evil	well done mr powers were not so different you and i its true youre british and im belgian you have a full head of hair mine is slightly receding youre thin im about forty pounds overweight ok we are different im not making a very good point however isnt it ironic mr powers that the very things you stand for swinging free love parties distrust of authority are all now in the nineties considered to be evil maybe we have more in common than you care to admit
no man what we swingers were rebelling against were uptight squares like you whose bag was money and world domination we were innocent man if wed known the consequences of our sexual liberation we would have done things differently but the spirit would have remained the same  its freedom man	your freedom has cause more pain and suffering in the world than any plan i ever dreamed of face it freedom failed
it seems the tables have turned again dr evil	not really kill the little bastard see what i care
mr powers my job is to acclimate you to the nineties you know a lots changed since 1967	well as long as people are still having promiscuous sex with many anonymous partners without protection while at the same time experimenting with mindexpanding drugs in a consequencefree environment ill be sound as a pound
my mothers told me all about you	if its a lie goddamn her it its the truth goddamn me  god i hope thats witty hows your mum

pretty groovy jumbo jet eh how does a hot chick like you end up working at the ministry of defense	i went to oxford and excelled in several subjects but i ended up specializing in foreign languages i wanted to travel  see the world in my last year i was accepted into the mod in the cultural studies sector i thought i was off on an exciting career but my job was to read everything printed in every country its very boring my whole day is spent reading wedding announcements in farsi if i do well with this case i finally get promoted to field operative

ive been frozen for thirty years man i want to see if my bits and pieces are still working	excuse me

the details of my life are quite inconsequential	thats not true doctor please tell us about your childhood
hi	hello scott im your father dr evil  i have a son i have a son everyone i have a son  someday scott this will all be yours

an evil petting zoo	you always do that  anyways this is really hard because you know my dad is really evil
scott my boy come here how was your day	well me and a buddy went to the video arcade in town and like they dont speak english right and so my buddy gets into a fight and he goes hey quit hassling me cause i dont speak french or whatever and the other guy goes something in paris talk and i go um just back off and he goes get out and i go make me
fascinating what are your plans for this evening	thought id stay in theres a good tittie movie on skinemax

i hate you i hate you i wish i was never artificially created in a lab	scott dont say that
we also own the franklin mint which makes decorative handpainted theme plates for collectors  some plates like the gone with the wind series have gone up in value as much as twohundred and forty percent but as with any investment there is some risk involved	gentlemen i have a plan its called blackmail the royal family of britain are the wealthiest landowners in the world either the royal family pays us an exorbitant amount of money or we make it look like prince charles the heir to the throne has had an affair outside of marriage and therefore they would have to divorce
um dr evil prince charles did have an affair he admitted it and they are now divorced actually	people have to tell me these things ive been frozen for thirty years throw me a bone here  ok no problem heres my second plan back in the sixties i had a weather changing machine that was in essence a sophisticated heat beam which we called a laser  using this laser we punch a hole in the protective layer around the earth which we scientists call the ozone layer slowly but surely ultraviolet rays would pour in increasing the risk of skin cancer that is unless the world pays us a hefty ransom
umm that also has already happened	right  oh hell lets just do what we always do lets hijack some nuclear weapons and hold the world hostage  gentlemen its come to my attention that a breakaway russian republic called kreplachistan will be transferring a nuclear warhead to the united nations in a few days heres the plan we get the warhead and we hold the world ransom  for one million dollars
dont you think we should ask for more than a million dollars a million dollars isnt that much money these days	all right then  five million dollars
virtucon alone makes over nine billion dollars a year	oh really  onehundred billion dollars  ok make it happen anything else
oh hello vanessa how was the flight	great
hows austin	hes asleep
you didnt	oh god no i made him sleep on the couch
im proud of you	why
well god knows he tried but ive been rather firm with him mummy you didnt tell me he was so obsessed with sex its bizarre	you cant judge him by modern standards hes very much a product of his times in my day he could have any woman he wanted
what about his teeth	you have to understand in britain in the sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth it didnt matter
i just dont see it	just wait once austin gets you in his charms its impossible to get out
did you ever	of course not i was married to your father
did you ever want to	austin is very charming very debonair hes handsome witty has a knowledge of fine wines sophisticated a worldrenowned photographer women want him men want to be him hes a lover of love every bit an international man of mystery
so scott why dont we start with you why are you here	well its kind of weird
we dont judge here	ok well i just really met my dad for the first time three days ago he was partially frozen for thirty years i never knew him growing up he comes back and now he wants me to take over the family business
and how do you feel about that	i dont wanna take over the family business
what do you want to do scott	i dont know i was thinking maybe id be a vet or something cause i like animals and stuff
we dont label people here scott	no hes really evil
were not yet open for business im afraid	shame i was recommended by a friend
normally wed be eager to oblige 	seriously
of course natural weather delivered to your door on demand down your phoneline for limited periods	you dont say how real does it feel

congratulations mrs peel you have been a worthy opponent you have tracked us down you are within an ace of winning	this isnt a game

london the world council of ministers meets soon on global defence if you can control the weather you control the world	after the cold war 
what are you trying to do to me	we want to help
i thought i was a widow my husband  the only man i ever loved  is dead for the rest of my life i have to live with that	the death of peter peel was a great loss to us all 
peter peel was a first class agent a senior operative x department special operations he was engaged in top secret research top priority  government approved	the institute  the funding 
who	quite frankly  it could have been you
this is an official matter mrs peel no need to take it personally where are you going	to find out who killed my husband
the doors and walls are monitored mrs peel this is a very secure establishment	so am i
about your next assignment mrs peel 	next assignment
ahem as i was saying perhaps another macaroon 	thank you steed
good luck  peter  emma	thanks valentine 
you	darling emma  yes we  the true genius behind the prospero project 
a slight miscalculation  my face was burned beyond recognition fortunately my research into plastics came in handy 	dr darling peter  all you 
an unholy trinity 	you killed my husband
for starters of course i had to kill the teddy bears as well 	too many cooks 
spoil the majority shareholders in wonderland weather i planned everything even the ministry recruiting you 	but i found you all the clues led me here 
you disappoint me emma  cant you guess  for you it was all for you 	our revels now are ended
think of this as your second wedding feast 	im already married 
you know i believe shes actually jealous	valentine listen to me 
thats better i say isnt this where you came in its impenetrable by the way 	youre mad
such as	destruction of their local weather systems i can zap a thousand chernobyls into the air
the result would be 	chaos transport paralysis crop failure  economic disaster frostbite or sunburn  on a massive scale youve seen a few samples
then whats stopping you	one very small thing a diamond cyclone chip a thousand times more information on a fraction of the size if i possess that my powers would be unlimited my dear halfbrother was developing it but he suspected sabotage he gave the chip to  you mrs peel i want you but also your ring
the missing piece of the jigsaw i tried to get you to give it to me as peter i tried to steal it from you as dr darling as myself ill be a bit less subtle  with this ring my plan will be complete	how wagnerian  do you mean to say youve waited all these years because you couldnt create a chip on your own that would have amused peter
speaking of peter theres more good news you wont even have to change your last name youll always be mrs peel	what are my choices
choices	ill never marry you
doctor peel i presume	and you must be steed please dont get up
i was about to throw in the towel	i had a spot of bother at the door
i shouldnt wonder not a woman inside boodles since 	1922 why the kippers
congratulations youve penetrated a bastion of male privilege i guessed you werent a stickler for tradition doctor	whereas you are
not by me play by the rules doctor or the game is nothing	and just what is the game
i didnt mother did	mother
 showers followed by sunny periods	were not here to talk about the weather surely
ah  from trubshaws  my shoemaker	a kipper or a red herring what were they investigating
my father always wanted a boy	really  i fail to see the connection
i thought we were on our way	oh absolutely but trubshaws a man worth meeting no point setting out half shod
steed we really must be 	ahh perfect fit the luxury of a handmade shoe as unique as a face or a fingerprint or should i say dna
you can but i wish you wouldnt 	thank you trubshaw 
that place is so absurd so out of date 	do you really think so
you know what i mean this car  and you nobody walks around like that milk	not all tradition is bad mrs peel no thank you
and i suppose youre the knight	the most unpredictable piece on the board and always ready to protect his queen
sir august merryweather  why are we seeing him first	as per mothers instructions
do we always follow mothers instructions	for a man in my position 
just what is your position if you dont mind my asking  how did a stuffed shirt like you get into this line of work	they call me in when theyve reached a dead end freelance like yourself
i have no choice why should you risk your life	after our fencing match i was rather hoping you would do the risking more tea
no thanks	i meant me
according to mother sir august owns half of the highlands a millionaire former head of special projects at the ministry now 	an eccentric recluse
not so much eccentric more barking mad he has a wife called june and a daughter somewhere  julie	june july  august
the family does seem to be somewhat meteorologically inclined	any other vices
so  i distract him while you snoop around how	small talk  try the weather
ah brenda   mrs peel	you should be dead  how do you feel
strange	you were very lucky  four shots to the heart i found you after i slipped away from sir august mother brought you here not me you should thank
mother and dr darling have me under observation they think i tried to kill you	why should they think that
you told them you said i arrived on a camel shot you four times left you for dead	frankly thats how i remember it
but thats absurd i may not be overfond of you steed but its not my style	perhaps your memory plays tricks mrs peel
an invitation to a formal picnic	did you say formal i must dress
either way  may i ask why you dress in that fashion	i should have thought that was obvious   im in mourning
colonel crabtree international satellite systems formerly of the ministry	how on earth can you tell

common knowledge mrs peel 	she had this in her mouth there there
but	dont bother  heres a bus 
not quite this is my field	is there anything that isnt
thats what we were working on	sounds as if someones hijacked your research
then a mad millionaire head of a secret defense establishment a group of eccentrics obsessed by weather 	 and by you mrs peel everything points to you  no sisters  no undiscovered twin
is that what you think	oh well   just my type mrs peel

mother betrayed me she was going to replace me with a younger father  errand boy thats all i was find steed	well you found me have a sniff of this why dont you careful the scent can be overpowering 
mother i thought you were burglars	brenda and i thought wed drop in
weathers turning nasty	you didnt come to talk about the weather surely

amnesia	possibly split personality

brian do you always have to be so stupid think about your future for once	so now you suddenly care about my future
look i didnt mean to take a piece out of you back there i just thought youd call when you came back you didnt and  dont blow it just because of this garbage between us	hey sorry if i made you look bad in front of your boss but im not gonna be a poster boy for him im trying to do something here theres five hundred smoke eaters in this room that do that stuff for real every day tell swayzak to talk to one of them
ive been thinking about what you said the other night if the offers still on the table id like to talk about it	okay ill arrange things with your assignment captain  martys a good man brian
arson	straightest answer your departments given me all week

you think thats really any of your business	well you did invite me here
okay	boy rimgales as slow as a snail isnt he
no hes more of a dinosaur guys not a dummy though hes juggling alot of balls on this one	yeah but it doesnt take albert einstein just to figure out if these guys were killed by accidents or not
jesus give him a break there isnt enough proof yet to go public sure we found some chemical shit we think somebody dumped in the plugs to torch em and weve maybe figured out why backdrafts but you cant rush this stuff not till its locked	but rimgales probably going to come around to arson
thanks for the invite	got anything to drink in there
this is one of the oldest fire stations in the city lotta tradition locked up in here what do you think	homey
when i came back i knew more than anything else that i wanted to be a fireman	then why did you quit
well our specimen here is your basic standard issue piece of primary suppression equipment this area is the pumping panel which controls the rate of liquid insertion into the hose	uh huh
brian whats wrong	you told swayzak about our arson lead its all over the fucking news
i didnt know it was a secret there arent supposed to be secrets between the city and its investigators 	 bullshit you knew what i told you wasnt ready for the papers 
will you please keep your voice down theres people 	 you could have scared the son of a bitch off we may never bust him now all for a couples political points
i was doing my job	yeah and just how much of all this has been doing your job
let me ask you something do you really think marty had you assigned to arson because of your firefighting skills who the hell are you kidding i was there remember i saw you and your brother 	leave stephen out of this 
oh yeah hes the real fireman  who are you just another probie working for swayzak 	 i work for the city
hi	hi
we still talking  look im sorry about the other day 	swayzak knows something about the guys that were murdered i want to know why he keeps that hidden
i dont know anything about it	you could check itd be in his files
do you know what youre asking me to do	yes
what is 	just take it
im sorry	thats a dumb thing to say
i think your boss is going to need some spin control	i quit two days ago brian
whatll you do	i dont have the slightest idea
ill see ya around huh	its a small town
im close but i cant get who it is	so you came to me  well this is going to be an interesting afternoon after all
okay heres the deal ill tell you a story you tell me one fair	whos doing this
your first question should be who isnt it isnt a spark brian not enough damage and an insurance pro wheres the profit margin	then who 
 no no your turn tell me a story	i dont have a story
famous story even straight burn just an engine and truck first on scene what did you feel brian when you first got there	what
you gotta tell a story too brian its fair cmon dont think too hard 	i i thought it was great i loved it it was nothing to these guys medium deal
right light smoke low roll couplea civilians hollering  medium deal so young fireman adcox and captain mccaffrey they head up stairs get out on the fire escape  mccaffrey does the ballsy jump across what were you feeling brian  cmon you promised be honest  okay guard	 i wanted to be him right then i wanted to be him more than anything
very good brian  about your report here the way to a torchs heart is through his tools thats how you know him its the way he talks to the fire and to you if you listen	the outlets
thats a probie answer youre smarter than that brian	trychticholorate
who the fuck is doing this	after it took your dad the fire did it look at you brian did it talk to you
oh jesus christ	not such a far walk after all is it brian
if you remember sir my test scores were in the top 	 i dont give a damn what your test scores were maybe you could have been a good firemen but you had your shot
i need another one sir	sorry but its out of my hands try again next year
no it isnt out of your hands or you wouldnt even have met me if i push you have to let me back in dead hero father rule sir	even if you graduate this academy youve still got nine months of probation thats hard duty son if you dont really love this job itll kill you
uh im brian mccaffrey your new assistant	your dennis kid  i work alone
are you still here	get used to me inspector im not going anywhere
then go find a corner i dont want you in my way	i think we should get something straight here i was assigned to this office by the city
where are you going	pest control
 shhh	what are you listening to
glass found in ignition room is in small thin pieces indicating explosion lack of discoloration indicates a long slow burn explosion must of come after a slow burn  you little tease what were you up to you little bastard huh what made you that mad  or scared  it started in this room took its time hung out but the air ran out it couldnt breathe so it was snuffed but it wasnt dead still all that trapped heat lying low waiting for some sucker to open the door and give it that one gulp of air	 another backdraft
temperature in this room was about 2000 degrees but copper wire in outlet is melted which requires 5000 degrees an accidental short in the plug could of created a spark of 7000 degrees hot enough to melt the wire and start a fire	no it couldnt
uh i dont think thats in my contract	i just rewrote your contract cmere
read	trychtichlorate is a binary structured 
 go to the bottom under heat properties	during heat episodes of 2000 kelvin or higher trych breaks down and dissipates will consume magnesium
son of a bitch tears em apart just to eat the oxygen wouldnt take much at all to melt ten gauge wire problems burnt magnesium leaves a powder trace  unless you could find something that would eat its residue	trychticholorate then swayzak can announce seagrave was a murder
i dont guess	some people say you dont do much of anything when it comes to this case
i got it after we talked to ronald torches want to fry the whole goddamn world but the fires that killed those guys never really burned up much  the burns were all lit in outlets surrounded by double firebreaks in the walls and he made his burns backdrafts 	but he killed these guys
but he could have killed everybody there the firebreaks kept it from spreading in the wall the backdraft blew out the flame thats it thats the reason	what reason
why backdrafts whoever fried seagrave and cosgrove went to a helluva lot of trouble to make sure they died by fire but also made sure the fire blew itself out	thats why the sealant on the doors so what have we got a torch with a conscience
no we have a stone killer trying to make a point	are you going public with this
what the hell are you doing here	im finished with swayzak ill do whatever you want me to do i just want to help catch the guy that burned tim you gotta give me another shot
in a word brian what is this job all about	fire
hey boss dekom trust is owned by pan illinois which is majority controlled by lakeside dynamics which is a division of windy city ventures whos partners are  alan seagrave donald cosgrove and jeffrey holcomb	son of a bitch they knew each other
so seagrave and holcomb were accountants	and cosgrove coppers figured he laundered money for the mob before getting into real estate they werent very high on seagrave either
nice bunch of guys	who all ended up wearing candles for faces  swayzaks up to his ass in this somehow guy can barely hold a drink in his hand hes so scared
this is the copy of swayzaks manning report that was released everybody on this job knows its bullshit but we could never argue with the numbers theyre all airtight	yeah airtight
ive got three different drafts of the same report  with different numbers thatre all over the place looks like they were just making it up as they went along	did a little check on the consulting firm that wrote the report they did exactly one job  swayzaks manpower study its not even really a company no employees no directors just a po box
well brian i guess you can say its arson now	how ya feeling
did you pull me out	yeah
just wondering	i hate hospitals youre so so goddamn useless
so what do you want me to do	ive been lying here hours just thinking were close  were not looking in the right place brian this one knows us and were not looking in the right place
your brother was a good man	yeah
another couple of good men get burned up for their city is that how its going to read  youre the only one that knows	like it never happened
bout written you off how long have you been in town	four months
four months	i know i know shoulda called ive been really busy i joined the fire department
sean come on out man what you forget your favorite uncle	stephen told him you were killed in a hot tub accident
well thats two things to strangle stephen for where is he anyway	stephens not staying here now brian he moved out last april
oh man im sorry	you guys ought to try picking up a phone once in awhile
yeah big fan	and im a huge fan of what you did to save that woman brian
every little boys fantasy	brian let me come to the point id like to offer you a job
i have a job	this ones still with the fire department one of our best investigators don rimgale is working on a very difficult visible case right now we think he could use another pair of hands and youre exactly the kind of guy i want representing us an authentic hero from a traditional firefighting clan
yeah we got all kinds of traditions  like dying young	not every job in the fire department comes with a tombstone brian this could be a great opportunity to move beyond a fire engine
mr mccaffrey	nice boat
completely out of control	what the hell are we waiting for
howd you know these are supposed to be sealed	lucky guess  and a case of scotch to a captain in station assignments
you crooked son of a bitch why 115	lots of fires they promote faster there take a look at the last lts list half the guys on it came from that battalion gotta think about your future timmy 115s the station
man something sure put a crimp in his evening	backdraft

yknow what stephen said to me right when all the shit was coming hard you never know till the moment the fire stares you down if youre just gonna do this job or be great at it	ah man is he usin that line now on you what you think he made that little gem up jesus christ i used to have to listen to my old man use that every morning
what	probationary fireman brian mccaffrey on his very first fire showed the kind of bravery and courage of a veteran firefighter when he risked life and limb to doublecheck a burning floor alone emerging victoriously with anna rodriguez a seamstress for the north shore clothing company mccaffrey first gained prominence as the subject of a 1972 pulitzer prize winning photograph taken at the scene of his fathers death
so you surviving without me	theres no replacement cause of your boss cuts if thats what you mean if someone else goes out on an injury were really screwed

i want you to start using the name mantan and not manray if you dont mind	why
mantan	mantan
im not playin myself no mo	how you sound
im always gonna be that  but i aint doing no more buck dancing	no costume  no blackface
our guest today is pierre delacroix he is the creator of the highly controversial tv show mantan lets get right into it  you have been called by some in the community a traitor a sellout an uncle tom why does your show generate such feelings	because race has always been a sensitive issue in this country gary i have no problem with people disagreeing with the show its when folks start trying to mess with my inherent right as an artist thats when i get mad  no one in any way shape or form should be censored
but the line has to be drawn	dont you people get it  were in the 21st century  slavery was over four hundred years ago  all that stuff people talked in the old days its over  folks always crying white man this white man that  lets all grow up
exactly thirtytwo minutes ago	im sorry im late
do you know how much information can be dispensed in one minute alone	i didnt find out about this very important staff meeting until
four minutes ago	so are you telling me everyone knew about this gettogether except you
do you know what cp time is	cp time is colored peoples time the stereotypical belief that negroes are always late  that negroes have no sense of time  time except when it comes to music or dance
i understand black culture  i grew up around black people all my life if the truth be told i probably know niggers better than you monsieur delacroix  please dont get offended by my use of the quoteunquote n word  i got a black wife and three biracial children so i feel i have a right to use that word  i dont give a damn what spike says tarantino is right  nigger is just a word  if dirty ole bastard can use it every other word so can i	i would prefer you not use that word in my presence
the material youve been creating is too white bread  white people with black faces  the huxtables cosby revolutionary  but thats dead  we cant go down that road again	i dont agree  the negro middle class does exist and its rich material for a dramatic series or sitcom
the middle class black family moves into a white suburban enclave  the middle class black family moves into a small southern town that is run by the kkk  the middle class single black father raises his teenage daughter  the middle class single black father raises his teenage daughter  the middle class single black mother raises her teenage son  and so on and so forth  its too clean too antiseptic	to white  i still feel all of my scripts would make good shows
delacroix wake up brother man the reason why they didnt get picked up was because nobody  and i mean nobody  niggers and crackers alike wants to see that junk	ive never been given a fair shot
you got your head stuck up your ass with your harvard education and your pretentious ways  brother man im blacker than you  im keepin it real and youre frontin trying to be white	im an oreo a sell out  because i dont aspire to do homeboys from out of space secret diary of desmond pfeiffer a pjs or some as you might put it some nigger show  im a tom  im whiter than white and youre blacker than black is that what you think
thats exactly what i think  i want you to create something that people want to see  lets be honest the majority of the people in the country are deaf dumb and blind and im including 35 million africanamericans  you know and i know niggers set the trend set the styles  this is a golden opportunity now  these idiots have to be led to the water	im not sure if i can deliver what you want
delacroix im glad you got your mind right	its right and tight  good morning let me introduce you to everybody you know my assistant sloan
were all happy to be here and im going to paint a picture for you	im wid it
word	so lets take this great form this very american tradition of entertainment into the 21st century into the new millennium
the name of the show	it is called mantan  the new millennium minstrel show
im feelin dis	it will take a lot of courage and backbone on the part of the cns to get this on the air  in fact i would understand fully if the subject matter is deemed too risque too controversial
dont worry about that thats my department  now who do we cast we need a star  can whoopi sing or dance	i dont know if whoopi is the way to go
every week we follow the trials and tribulations of two real coons  mantan and sleep n eat  the dusky duo	what are there character traits
mantan is an uneducated negro who always by some stroke of unbelievable stupidity makes his best laid plans go haywire	and sleep n eat is his comical sidekick
yep you guessed it	this could be bigger than amos and andy
protest finally forced amos and andy off the air  could stop us from ever getting on	letem try  i will kill to make this happen
negroes would be in an uproar	so what  we would just give the naacp a donation that would be the end of that  no such thing as bad publicity  so what  earlier you said singing and dancing
mantan right here is a gifted hoofer  he has educated feet	who are the other characters
we gonna hit em wid da bomb dickey on dis one  whats the setting	in the projects  like eddie murphys the pjs
and every week these alabama porch monkeys will make us cry make us laugh make us look at our own humanity  make us feel good to be alive	i dont know about that plantation angle
i strongly feel that a negro should direct this  this kind of satire is a high wire act in a gale storm one misstep and were doing amos and andy  only a negro will have the sensitivity and cultural awareness to navigate this dangerous terrain	to hire someone solely on their ethnicity gender or religion is not right  its unamerican  i will hire someone who is most qualified for this particular job
youre telling me some white boy is gonna direct this pilot	i just want you to meet him  keep an open mind
besides what does he know about negroes	probably nuthin but thats why its such a sexy way to go sometimes an outsider has a fresh new outlook a different unique perspective  a black director yknow what hes gonna do given the subject matter  with this kid the possibilities are endless
what are his qualifications besides being a white male and directing a hot new sexy freaky madonna video	if spielburg can direct the color purple and amistad our whiz kid can direct the mantan pilot
thats exactly my point  has he even directed actors before in anything	no  just meet the guy  thats all im asking  look ill even let you choose your own musical director  you can have that
in the immortal words of derrick coleman whooopdeedamndoo	derrick coleman he possessed all the talent in the world coulda shoulda been a great ballplayer but alas dc didnt want it bad enough  delacroix do you want it bad enough to kill for it  do you want it that much
i will not be held responsible for these revisions  these changes are not the way i want to go  this is an outrage  this is a sham  a violation	calm down please
funnier to who and at whos expense dunwitty when negroes start to run amok the boycotts when the demostrations commence im giving them your home address  lets see how you like it when they picket your lawn in greenwich connecticut	i seriously doubt that will ever happen  didnt i tell you i know your people better than you do but if by some miracle youre correct im gonna invite them inside my house and well have a sit down discuss it like civil human beings
yo dela i just got the news from the cns brass  they saw some clips from the pilot and theyre rushing it onto the air  yo were a midseason replacement ordered 12 shows  were on in 3 weeks  didya hear what i just said yo	they didnt even view a rough cut just some scenes we quickly cut together
this has to be a big mistake	the big mistake was my not believing in your genius earlier  from the gitgo from jump street
what do you want	i want to speak with you
go away unless you got my money	its me peerless
son  good to seeya  good to seeya	its been a long time
pull up a chair  oh excuse me this is my lady dot	pleased to meet you
good woman  i trained her right	daddy shes younger than me
purely for medicinal purposes	i thought you had promised mommy you stopped
i did  im not an alcoholic  i just like to drink	how did you end up here
thats what im askin	because i had too much pride  too much integrity  i wouldnt lick nobodys butt  some material i refused to do
thats the only reason period they only want one certain kind of black comic	another one of your conspiracies to hold ya career back
the truth is never let them seeya sweat  you do that thats half the battle	where do you go from here
three nights charleston south carolina	i didnt mean that in life
lets get him over to the bed	baby you treat me so good peerless youre a good son i love you  you never gave me no trouble
glad to meet you too  you are all your father talks about	is that so
how long has my father been like this	not that often  he was excited to see you
so whats up with you	i was a hostess at this club your daddy was performing and i had never laughed so hard in my life he asked me to come with him  i quit my job and weve been together ever since
dont tell him its from me or he wont take it	your father is proud of you
he never showed it	he did the best way he knew how junebug is stubborn just like you
how was it	why didnt you tell me about this staff meeting
nobody told me anything	what good are you if you dont tell me stuff like this
manray	manray
how did you know	it hit me like a ton of bricks
how can this be  you and me at the same time the exact same thought its scary	the idea was out there in the universe  now what
what point is that	the point being that him the networks dont want black people on television unless they are buffoons
sounds risky to me	you getting cold feet
im in till the end	good  im going to need your support
cant you just quit  walk away	and lose out on my money  the only way i get paid is if i get fired and thats what i intend to do
what is your problem	my problem is mantan the new millenium minstrel show
why did you even come up with that shit if you didnt want it made	it was the principle  dunwitty had to be enlightened  i was making a point  i take pride in my work plus i already told you i wasnt gonna walk away from my money
i wouldnt bet against it  my negroidal ass is stuck between the proverbial rock and a hard place	like i said all this for some twisted distorted sense of principal  dunwitty he just tolerates your negroidal ass he doesnt respect it
this is the group i was telling you about	which one is your brother
just want to say good luck	break a leg
your life will never be the same	lets leave the man in peace so he can get ready
we both lied to him	what do you want me to say
same here	the pleasure is mine
i want to apologize about my brother and the maumaus  i should not have imposed them on you	cmon  you were only doing what family is supposed to be doing for family  you gave your brother a shot  thats all anybody can ask for an opportunity a chance a shot  he got his
what would their reaction be  i hadnt the foggiest	everybody shut up
so you have your small victory now what	a small victory isnt that small when youve been use to losing
for what	no matter what you think you did come up with something unique open it
the jolly nigger bank	this is authentic not a repro circa turn of the century
how so	to me it shows part of our history in this country a time when we were considered inferior subhuman
whyd you do that	i dont want to hear it
how long have you and hambone been hangin out	youre the one that put us together were friends
that crazy brother of yours doesnt think so	hes just playing big brother
oh is he  you getting jiggy with mantan	please dont go there
dunwitty and i feel youve been getting too close to him getting his mind all messed up	i cant lie to him  if he asks me something i tell him what i think
dela you should try it sometime come into the light	light
that which has been hidden in darkness is now in the light  this bucket of blood	you can talk all that mumbo jumbo if you want to but your hands are much bloody  i know where i made my big mistake  i have a general rule never get involved romantically with somebody crazier than you
this is crazy	thats why it will be so much fun
that was a mistake but i dont regret it	the first and only time  a big mistake  im gonna have to ask you not to see mantan anymore
otherwise  i trust you know the difference  youre an intelligent woman finished at nyu	dela kiss my big black ass
dont make me have to use this	i didnt think this was in your studies at nyu
i told you but you wouldnt listen you never listened to me	give me the gun
yes your name	he im mona
hi mona	i perfectly understand where youre coming from  as a minority i can relate to your struggle also  but i think you should give us all a chance  we want this pilot to be successful just as much as you please dont be so quick to judge us based only on our whiteness
this thing was rigged the deck was stacked the fix was in  could don king be near  good thing sloan had my back  shes my rock  this was going to be a whole lot of work	david i appreciate your comments anybody got an ideas  everybody just talk out loud
im happy for all of us  its just we have a great responsibility now the pressure is on	pressure  dela you dont know what the hell real pressure is sheeett  this is lightstuff now when you scramblin out on the street in da january winter and the hawk is talkin to you with no money and no prospects of money anytime soon now that there is some pressure
can i kiss you too	naw  ill take the zero
you feel good not nervous	i feel fine
not nervous  relaxed	sloan will you take your boss out of here so i can get ready
this is nothing  it will blow over by tomorrow	same thing giuliani said
no joke  serious	hope the same thing doesnt happen to me  thats some big shoes to fill
what are you  a man or a mouse are you a punk  punking out on me	no
you getting scared because some people dont like what you are doing	yo dela they tried to lynch my black ass up in dat piece
youve made it from the guttermost to the uppermost  dont you know you should never let them see you sweat  yknowwhatimsayin	yeah
you shouldnt even be mad at me over sloan	what you did is dead wrong
oh is it  buddy boy in this business if people dont produce they get fired	sloan is the hardest working person ive ever met
let me ask you a question if i may how do you think she got the job in the first place  i dont mean to burst your bubble mantan the marvelous but sloan is an opportunity	i dont believe it
mantan we got a show to tape	my name is manray goddamnit
you must think im some kind of fool	it looks delicious
you hear me talkin to you  the only time you come up here when something is wrong	cmon mommy dont start with that im an ungrateful son stuff
hows the food	cant beat it with a hammer  well since you asked it looks like i may have a new show a pilot being shot
it was  it is  but this is a different kind of show	if at first its not what you want just work that much harder peerless

richmond is not all the way down south	i dont even know why youre still concerned over him  daddys not with you
regardless he still is your father	its gonna be hard for me to get away with the show taking off
even more reason to see him  hell be overjoyed with your success	cmon mommy  daddy hasnt been impressed with anything ive ever done  from winning my fifth grade spelling bee to the present
im doing okay  been reading about your show its all over everywhere i watched its all over everywhere i watched it once  i thought you said there would be no buffoonery	you going to attack me too  the show is a hit  arent you happy for me

good luck jukka  do a good show	thank you very much  i always try my best
i know all of you have seen the overnight ratings  through the roof  but in this game you gotta be one two three steps ahead  i introduce you to myrna goldfarb shes the best media consultant in the biz	first i would like to say i love the show  its very courageous my parents marched in selma alabama with dr king
the mantan manifesto  catchy aint it  number one  we gainfully employ african americans in front of and behind the cameras  two let the audience decide  three who put these critics in charge these socalled cultural police four  who determines what is black five  mantan is a satire  six if they cant take a joke f em	we all stick to this its smooth sailing
let myrna finish	thank you  and always smile
yes you	this show was created conceived by you a nonthreatening african american male  voila  end of argument  it cant be racist because youre black
i never had a really real pair before	youve never had any formal training either
not a class not a thing just picked stuff up by myself	i wish i had your natural talent god only makes that visit once in a while
you sing and dance	a little  i just graduated from nyu film school  cinema studies
why do you say that  youve never seen me	i think that would probably make you the happiest  when im hoofing i mean really doing my thing hitting it nothing compares to that feeling in the world
our guest tonight is the extraordinary talented performer mantan  thanks for coming in	tavis thank you for having me
before we begin i want to thank you for coming on my show for your first television interview  you could have chosen mike wallace barbara walters jane pauley whatnot but youre here	im more comfortable around my people
lets jump right into it  your show has sparked a world of controversy provoked a tone of dialogue  how do you see all of this	yo tavis check it out  this is the twoone the 21st century and its all about the money  like my man mase says its all about the benjamins
money and nothing else	money makes the world go round  it aint no joke being poor  i know whatimtalkinbout yknowwhatimsayin  ive lived on the street  ive been homeless ive learned how to play the game work the game be in the game
is it inevitable that the game plays you	no if you go with the flow tavis thats what a lot of negroes dont understand  protesting isnt gonna do a damn thing  if people dont like our satire in our number one hit show then dont watch it  or better yet write your own show  do it better

aw cmon	thats ancient history  that has nothing to do with you and i
dont try to change to the subject	why dont you answer
i know i wont be your puppet	you can go now
good day to you young sir	good morning
where are you bound for	that is none of your business
is your mother not afraid on account of the highwayman to let one so young as you travel	not at all sir  i have a pair of good pistols that have already done execution and are ready to do it again
and ill tell you what mr dugan ive been insulted grossly in this house  i aint at all satisfied with these here ways of going on im an englishman i am and a man of property and i  i 	if youre insulted and not satisfied remember theres two of us best
hoitytoity  john best whats the matter here	ill tell you what it is mr dugan i have had enough of miss dugan here and your irish ways  i aint used to em sir
well well  what is it  well make you used to our ways or adopt english ones	its not the english way for ladies to have two lovers and so mr dugan ill thank you to pay me the sum you owe me and i resign all claims to this young lady  if she has a fancy for schoolboys let her take em sir
my companion treated me with great civility and asked me a thousand questions about england which i answered as best i might  but this best i am bound to say was bad enough  i knew nothing about england and i invented a thousand stories which i told him described the king and the ministers to him said the british ambassador in berlin was my uncle and promised my acquaintance a letter of recommendation to him	what is your uncles name
ogrady	oh yes of course ambassador ogrady
this is a very good inn  shall we stop for dinner	this may be a very good inn for germany but it would not pass in old ireland  corbach is only a league off let us push on for corbach
ah  you sly rogue i see that will influence you	the place seems more a farm than an innyard
wheres the beauty you promised me	it was my joke  i was tired and did not care to go farther  theres not prettier woman here than that if she wont suit your fancy my friend then you must wait awhile
upon my word sir i think you have acted very coolly	i have acted as i think fit
sir im a british officer	its a lie  youre a deserter youre an impostor sir your lies and folly have confirmed this to me you pretend to carry dispatches to a general who has been dead these ten months you have an uncle who is an ambassador and whose name you dont know  will you join and take the bounty sir or will you be given up
good morning private james  please come in  i should like you to meet my uncle herr minister of police galgenstein	how do you do sir
the captain was the nephew and heir of the minister of police herr galgenstein a relationship which no doubt aided in the younger gentlemens promotion	your loyalty to me and your service to the regiment has pleased me very well  and now there is another occasion on which you may make yourself useful to us if you succeed depend on it your reward will be your discharge from the army and a bounty of 100 guineas
you are a hungarian you served in the army and left on account of weakness in the loins  he gambles a great deal and wins  do you know the cards well	only a very little as soldiers do
what are the chevaliers intentions	i am not sure  the prince told him quite clearly that if he wished to have the money he would have to fight for it
has he sent the challenge yet	not yet but i believe he intends to
this is a pretty way to recommend yourself to the family	the man that marries dorothy dugan must first kill me  do you mind that
dorothy might love me or not as she likes but best will have to fight me before he marries her	faith i think you are a lad thats likely to keep your word
a pretty days work of it you have made master roderick  knowing your uncle to be distressed for money and try and break off a match which will bring fifteen hundred ayear into the family  best has promised to pay off the four thousand pounds which is bothering your uncle so he takes a girl without a penny  a girl that has been flinging herself at the head of every man in these parts these ten years past and missing them all and a boy who ought to be attached to your uncle as to your father	and so i am
and this is the return you make for his kindness  didnt he harbor you in his house when your father died and hasnt he given you and your mother rentfree your fine house of jamesville yonder	mark this come what will of it i swear i will fight the man who pretends to the hand of dorothy dugan  ill follow him if its into the church and meet him there ill have his blood or he shall have mine  will you take my message to him and arrange the meeting
have you taken my message to him	the meeting is arranged  captain best is waiting for you now
my mare is saddled and ready whos the captains second	your cousins go out with him
thats a very handsome sword you have there	it was with this sword that my late father harry james god rest his soul met sir huddelstone fuddelstone the hampshire baronet and was fatally run through the neck  he was quite in the wrong having insulted lady fuddelstone when in liquor at the brentford assembly  but like a gentleman he scorned to apologize
and now you risk the same fate  if you are killed your mother is all alone in the world	i am harry james son and will act as becomes my name and quality
i hope to spoil this sport and trust to see this sword of mine in that big bullys body	oh its with pistols we fight  you are no match for best with the sword
ill match any man with the sword	but swords are today impossible captain best is  is lame  he knocked his knee against the swinging park gate last night as he was riding home and can scarce move it now
not against castle dugan gate that has been off the hinges these ten years	it must have been some other gate
grogan gave me a wink of recognition but offered no public token of acquaintance and it was not until two days afterwards that he called me into his quarters and then shaking hands with me cordially gave me news which i wanted of my family	i had news of you in dublin  faith youve begun early like your fathers son but i think you could not do better than as you have done but why did you not write home to your poor mother  she has sent halfadozen letters to you in dublin
i suppose she addressed them to me in my real name by which i never thought to ask for them at the post office	we must write to her today and you can tell her that you are safe and married to brown bess
i see you are thinking of a certain young lady at duganstown	is miss dugan well
theres only six miss dugans now poor dorothy	good heavens  whatever  has she died of grief
she took on so at your going away that she was obliged to console herself with a husband  she is now mrs john best	mrs john best  was there another mr john best
no the very same one my boy  he recovered from his wound  the ball you hit him with was not likely to hurt him  it was only made of tow do you think the dugans would let you kill fifteen hundred ayear out of the family  the plan of the duel was all arranged in order to get you out of the way for the cowardly englishman could never be brought to marry from fear of you  but hit him you certainly did roderick and with a fine thick plugget of tow and the fellow was so frightened that he was an hour in coming to we told your mother the story afterwards and a pretty scene she made	the coward
mr ohiggins we are in your debt and rest assured sir you have friends in this house whenever you are in dublin  mister ohiggins i wonder if i know your good father	which ohiggins do you know  for i have never heard your name mentioned in my family
whom have i been harboring in my house  who are you sirrah	sirrah  sirrah i am as good a gentleman as any in ireland
youre an impostor young man a schemer a deceiver	repeat the words again and i run you through the body
chevalier though i cannot say how i believe you have cheated me	i deny your graces accusations and beg you to say how you have been cheated
i dont know	your grace owes me seventy thousand frederics which i have honorably won
chevalier if you will have your money now you must fight for it if you will be patient maybe i will pay you something another time	your grace if i am so tame as to take this then i must give up an honorable and lucrative occupation
good gracious  what is this	you are going to drive to the frontier
it is shameful  infamous  i insist upon being put down at the austrian ambassadors house	i have orders to gag your honor if you cry out and to give you this purse containing ten thousand frederics if you do not
ten thousand  but the scoundrel owes me seventy thousand	your honor must lower his voice
i have no luggage	the gentleman has nothing contraband
you are the young man who m de seebach recommended	yes sir  here is my letter
you come highly recommended by herr seebach	herr seebach was a very kind employer
for whom else have you worked	no one sir  before that i served in the army but had to leave due to weakness of the loins
who else can give me information about you	only the agency of servants
and i think he was as much affected as i was at thus finding one of his kindred for he too was an exile from home and a friendly voice a look brought the old country back to his memory again and the old days of his boyhood	id give five years of my life to see the old country again the greenfields and the river and the old round tower and the burying place
the cards are now my only livelihood  sometimes i am in luck and then i lay out my money in these trinkets you see  its property look you and the only way i have found of keeping a little about me when the luck goes against me why my dear my diamonds go to the pawnbrokers and i wear paste  do you understand the cards	i can play as soldiers do but have no great skill
but they will prevent a meeting at whatever the cost	have no fear  it will come out well for me
i believe they will deport you	i have faced that problem before
but if they send you away then what is to become of me	make your mind easy you shall not be left behind i warrant you  do take a last look at your barracks make your mind easy say a farewell to your friends in berlin  the dear souls how they will weep when they hear you are out of the country and out of it you shall go
gentlemen i wish you a good day will you please go to the house from whence we set out this morning and tell my man there to send my baggage on to three kings at dresden	then ordering fresh horses the chevalier set off on his journey for that capital  i need not tell you that i was the chevalier
when the duke of courland brought fourteen lackeys each with bags of florins and challenged our bank to play against the sealed bags what did we ask	sir we have but eighty thousand florins in bank or two hundred thousand at three months if your highness bags do not contain more than eight thousand we will meet you
i risk nothing for i am certain to kill him	certain
i entered here monsieur at a bad moment for you it seems that you love this lady	certainly monseigneur does not your excellency consider her worthy of love
perfectly so and what is more i will tell you that i love her and that i am not of a humor to put up with rivals	very well  now that i know it i will no longer love her
very well but a man who yields takes to his legs	that is a trifle strong
no	have you had one
never	but for a time a passing fancy
not even that	how can i believe that there is not a man who has inspired desires in you
not one	have you not a man whom you value
your word empty makes me laugh is it fortunate or unfortunate  if it is fortunate i congratulate myself  if it is unfortunate i do not care for i am not aware of it	it is nonetheless a misfortune and you will know it when you love
it is only too possible  love requires a mutual harmony which is difficult and it is even more difficult to make it last	i agree but god put us on earth to take that risk
a man may need to do that and find it amusing but a girl is bound by other laws	i believe you and i see i must hasten to leave for otherwise i shall become the unhappiest of men
you want my heart	it is my only object
the amusing thing is that you deceive me without knowing if it is true that you love me	deceiving someone without knowing it is something new for me  if i do not know it i am innocent
be so good as to tell me with whom you think you are	with a woman who is completely charming be she a princess or a woman of the lowest condition and who regardless of her rank will show me some kindness tonight
poor man  and for that reason you want to begin where people end	i ask only a payment on account today  after that you will find me undemanding obedient and discreet
i know better than you do  love wants a more substantial fare and if it is stubbornly withheld it withers away	our abstinence makes our love immortal  if i loved you a quarter of an hour ago now i should love you even more  but i should love you less if you exhausted my joy by satisfying all my desires
let us give each other complete happiness and let us be sure that as many times as we satisfy our desires they will each time be born anew	my husband has convinced me of the contrary
shall i tell you something  i believed what was called love came after the union  and i was surprised when my husband making me a woman made me know it only by pain unaccompanied by any pleasure i saw that my imaginings had stood me in better stead  and so we became only friends seldom sleeping together and arousing no curiosity in each other yet on good terms for a while as whenever he wanted me i was at his service but since the offering was not seasoned with love he found it tasteless and seldom demanded it	o my dearest love  enough  i beg you  stop believing in your experience  you have never known love  my very soul is leaving me catch it on your lips and give me yours
without you my dearest i might have died without ever knowing love inexpressible love  god of nature bitterness than which nothing is sweeter sweetness than which nothing is more bitter  divine monster which can only be defined by paradoxes	let me give a thousand kisses to that heavenly mouth which has told me that i am happy
as soon as i saw you loved me i was pleased and i gave you every opportunity to fall more in love with me being certain that for my part i would never love you  but after our first kiss i found that i had no power over myself  i did not know that one kiss could matter so much	we then spent an hour in the most eloquent silence except that from time to time her ladyship cried out  oh my god  is it true  i am not dreaming
my lady cosgroves relationship with me was a singular one  her life was passed in a series of crackbrained sort of alternation between love and hatred for me  we would quarrel for a fortnight then we should be friends for a month together sometimes  one day i was joking her and asking her whether she would take the water again whether she had found another lover and so forth  she suddenly burst out into tears and after a while said to me	roderick you know well enough that i have never loved but you  was i ever so wretched that a kind word from you did not make me happy ever so angry but the least offer of goodwill on your part did not bring me to your side  did i not give a sufficient proof of my affection for you in bestowing one of the finest fortunes of england upon you  have i repined or rebuked you for the way you have wasted it no i loved you too much and too fondly i have always loved you from the first moment i saw you i saw your bad qualities and trembled at your violence but i could not help loving you  i married you though i knew i was sealing my own fate in doing so and in spite of reason and duty  what sacrifice do you want from me  i am ready to make any so you will but love me or if not that at least you will gently us me
lady cosgrove you are an old fool	old fool
i accept but i insist on a wager the loser must do whatever the winner pleases	agreed
i feel the ribbon	then you must get it
why are you shaking	with pleasure at finding the ribbon
i hate miss clancy you know i do and i only danced with her because  because  the person with whom i intended to dance chose to be engaged the whole night	i had not been in the room five minutes before i was engaged for every single set
were you obliged to dance five times with captain best and then stroll out with him into the garden	i dont care a fig for captain best he dances prettily to be sure and is a pleasant rattle of a man  he looks well in his regimentals too and if he chose to ask me to dance how could i refuse him
suppose now roderick you who are such a hero was passing over the bridge and the enemy on the other side	id draw my sword and cut my way through them
what with me on the pillion  would you kill poor me	well then ill tell you what id do  id jump daisy into the river and swim you both across where no enemy could follow us
i am at your service mr cosgrove how much do you wish to spend	as much as possible
as much as possible	yes for i wish to entertain splendidly
all the same you must name an amount	it is entirely up to you  i want the best
last month the duke of suffolk spent no more	all right five hundred guineas
and to be sure i did know someone who knew precisely how these things were done and this was the distinguished solicitor and former government minister lord west whose acquaintance i made as i had so many others at the gaming table	do you happen to know gustavus adolphus the thirteenth earl of crabs
does this assignment interest you	yes minister i am interested in any work in which i can be of service to captain galgenstein
a meeting with the prince of turbingen is impossible	the prince left him only that choice
the king has determined to send the chevalier out of the country	when is he to go
what has happened madam to annoy your ladyship	oh i am grateful to you sir  i am the wife of captain oreilly hastening to join him at dublin  my chair was stopped by a highwayman this great oaf of a servantman fell down on his knees armed as he was and though there were thirty people in the next field working when the ruffian attacked not one of them would help but on the contrary wished him good luck
be off to your work you pack of rascals or you will have a good taste of my thong  have you lost much	everything  my purse containing upwards of a hundred guineas my jewels my snuffboxes watches and all because this blundering coward fell to his knees
that fool didnt know what was the meaning of a hundredpound bill which was in the pocketbook that the fellow took from me	i am riding to dublin myself and if your ladyship will allow me the honor of riding with you i shall do my best to protect you from further mishap
but i shouldnt like to put you to such trouble mister	ohiggins mohawk ohiggins
as you have been robbed of your purse may i have permission to lend your ladyship a couple of pieces to pay any expenses which you might incur before reaching your home	thats very kind of you mr ohiggins
how different was her lively rattle to the vulgar wenches at kilwangan assemblies  in every sentence she mentioned a lord or a person of quality  to the ladys question about my birth and parentage i replied that i was a young gentleman of large fortune that i was going to dublin for my studies and that my mother allowed me five hundred per annum	you must be very cautious with regard to the company you should meet in dublin where rogues and adventurers of all countries abound i hope you will do me the honor of accepting lodgings in my own house where captain oreilly will welcome with delight my gallant young preserver
considering your financial circumstances mr cosgrove it has been impossible to find anyone at all prepared to do any business with you  i think you may count yourself lucky to have this opportunity but obviously if you would reject this offer i shall keep trying to find a better one	i am prepared to accept the terms mr newcombe
mister bracegirdle said to me that he had heard her ladyship lives in some fear of her life and meditated a separation in which case she might later repudiate any documents signed by herself while in durance and subject them at any rate to a doubtful and expensive litigation they were quite insistent on this point and said they must have absolute assurance of her ladyships perfect freewill in the transaction before they would advance a shilling of their capital	i see
did you buy the horse papa	now just have a little patience my boy  your birthday isnt until next week
good night papa	good night my little darling
papa	yes
one of the boys in the stable told nelly that youve already bought my horse and that its at doolans farm where mick the groom is breaking it in  is that true papa	what the devil  what kind of fools do we have here  pottle who told the lad this story
i promise your lordship a good flogging if you even so much as go to doolans farm to see him	yes papa
your bother is in america fighting the rebels	is he all right papa
i made sir william cosgroves acquaintance as usual at the play table  one could not but admire the spirit and gallantry with which he pursued his favorite pastime for though worn out with gout and a myriad of diseases a cripple wheeled about in a chair and suffering pangs of agony yet you would see him every morning and every evening at his post behind the delightful green cloth	hang it mr roderick james you have no more manners than a barber and i think my black footman has been better educated than you but you are a young fellow of originality and pluck and i like you sir  because you seem determined to go to the devil by a way of your own
indeed you are right sir  look at me  marriage has added forty years to my life  i am dying a wornout cripple at the age of fifty  when i took off lady cosgrove there was no man of my years who looked so young as myself  fool that i was i had enough with my pensions perfect freedom the best society in europe  and i gave up all these and married and was miserable  take a warning from me mr roderick and stick to the trumps  do anything but marry	would you have me spend my life all alone
in truth sir yes but if you must marry then marry a virtuous drudge	the milkmaids daughter
i beg your pardon	come come sir  i am a man who would rather be known as a cuckold than a fool
gentlemen see this amiable youth he has been troubled by religious scruples and has flown for refuge to my chaplin mr hunt who has asked for advise from my wife lady cosgrove and between them both they are confirming my ingenious young friend in his faith  did you ever hear of such doctors and such a disciple	faith sir if i want to learn good principles its surely better i should apply for them to your lady and your chaplin than to you
well if my intentions are what you think they are  if i do wish to step into your shoes what then  i have no other intentions than you had yourself  lady cosgroves wealth may be great but am i not of a generous nature enough to use it worthily  her rank is lofty but not so lofty as my ambition  i will be sworn to muster just as much regard for my lady cosgrove as you ever showed her and if i win her and wear her when you are dead and gone corbleu knight do you think that it will be the fear of your ghost will deter me	is it not a pleasure gentlemen for me as i am drawing near the goal to find my home such a happy one my wife so fond of me that she is even now thinking of appointing a successor  isnt it a comfort to see her like a prudent housewife getting everything ready for her husbands departure
i hope that you are not thinking of leaving us soon knight	not so soon my dear as you may fancy perhaps  why man i have been given over many times these four years and there was always a candidate or two waiting to apply for the situation  who knows how long i may keep you waiting
charming schuvaloff	blackeyed sczortarska
dark valdez	do you expect me to believe that your lover brought you here tonight
yes  he brought me in his carriage and he will call for me at midnight	and he doesnt care about me
he is only curious to know who you are	if his love were like mine he would not permit you to come here
he loves me as i love you	will he wish to know the details of this night

he  he made me do it 	do what
i guess nunez wasnt dead after all he came after us with a vengeance  you know the rest	and the bodies
i promised them id ask you where west and the others are	washout rejects guys he said were dumbfucks too stupid to know they dead
are you saying sergeant west tried to kill you	no maam he just wanted us to quit making it through was kind of an honor some of the other guys on the base told us that if you could hack section eight command would consider you at the top of the class
that first night with pike i made the mistake of letting him sit down at around 0300	tell us about the other guys the ones west weeded out
he was sickly had that shaking thing whatdyacall it epoxy	epilepsy
he said he worked there 	no did he tell you about it about the business childs ran
what business	pills shots you name it basics a lot easier when you dont feel pain 
where	the creek bed 
what about the phosphorous grenade	one went off yeah but it didnt touch him  i thought you knew this 
back up	mueller was alone in the cabin
you kept kendall alive to corroborate your story and he did it all they way up to the end you even gave him his own motive in case we decided to burn him too	cant do that now though can you
is that what i did now and of course you can prove all of it	we can prove that youre not ray dunbar impersonating a fellow cadet is a courtmartial in and of itself 
cadet whats your name	sir dunbar sir
you know how to work a pistol dunbar	sir yes sir
dunbar you are to stand here and guard this nigger for the next twenty four hours he is not to be given food water or clothes if he so much as moves you are to blow his nigger brains out is that clear	sir yes sir
what the fuck is going on	your weapons sergeant
he wouldnt kill anybody	oh bullshit hes a fucking convict you know how much he hated west 
shut up  let me see your grenades	why
jesus what happened	west hes dead
pike and i got separated then i heard gunfire close	so did we why didnt you come
what do you mean wests	i mean i killed him  isnt that what we all wanted
roberto what the fuck	we just want to check your pack 
you know its not like that 	do i
right	yeah
you gotta untie me  i didnt do this thing ray	you hated west more than any of us
maybe but that dont make me a killer 	youre the only one missing a grenade
ray this is my life here i aint gonna pretend im not happy west is gone but you know i couldnt have done this its not in me	if not you then who
mueller	oh come on 
were sweeping our area and suddenly hes gone couple minutes later phosphorous grenade pops off about a third of a click away 	thats exactly what he says about you
you hated west mueller loved him 	enough to go to prison childs px scam mueller was in on it 
bullshit	look in my pack
combat grade morphine mueller sold it to me	youre lying 
why why didnt you tell me	becoming a morphine addict during basic aint exactly something you want to broadcast only mueller and childs know
that still doesnt mean you didnt kill him	you saw west right how was he killed
way i figure it west must have found out about their little business and was gonna bust them so they decided to get rid of him first	they
theres no time to think ray we gotta get out of here you untie me we grab the guns get kendall and nunez and make a run for it 	no no we can just wait till we get back and then tell the mps 
a test will no doubt link you to the killing 	put it down
you ive seen you around the base but you  youre not army are you	coast guard special detective detail we feel this incident may have put the beaches of florida at risk
thats it youre that policeman with friends in low places tell me hows guissepe torres doing these days those racketeering indictments must have really been a downer 	levi you got about four hours before armed men show up here put you on a plane to washington and lock you in a very small dark room i suggest you talk to us
ive done nothing wrong  im the victim here	but not the only victim right
my father is a powerful man over the years hes used that power to protect me in one form or another from certain unpleasantries  i am a homosexual	senator daddy must be thrilled
he is not shall we say wild about the idea he has asked me on numerous occasions to be more discreet about my proclivities and i have done my best to oblige him however in the last four weeks i began a relationship with another cadet what do you think of that	i think you just blew dont ask dont tell out of the fucking water
levi i dont know if youre familiar with investigative work but we have this little thing called motive and you just gave yourself one	you said you wanted to know what happened  im telling you the truth
what happened to degrees	i didnt kill him 
maybe i shouldnt tell you that maybe i should tell you i wasnt scared at all but i was  enough to almost kill him	but you didnt
he admitted it	right in front of us mueller went after him but we held him back
okay i think thats it he rises and walks to the door	mr hardy
you tried to pin three stone murders on dunbar 	how many murders did you cover up one five maybe an even ten
epileptic attacks are murder on your system rattle your internal organs like a paint mixer	my heart weeps
is it the truth	theres that word again  as i told you i wasnt in the room when everyone started shooting
why did you tell us he shot everybody levi you put him in for three murders the man saved your life 	so i should stay silent about his misdeeds the guns went off i ran in childs shot me pike and mueller were dead and dunbar was running out the door with the smoking gun 
something funny levi	i was just thinking of whats going to happen to your careers when my father gets through with you
jail if hes lucky the gas chamber if hes not 	i didnt do anything 
why	because of what i saw  who really killed west
how do you know	because i was standing next to him
or you levi when is it finally going to come out that you were the one who killed him	i didnt 
you lied to us levi youre going to the gas chamber unless you tell us where to find them	i dont know 
where are they	maybe 
maybe what 	maybe he
how are you	been better  i read about whats been happening with you i should have called 
that bad	would i have called you if it wasnt if there was any other way 
the official term for it is clusterfuck by the time beth hit us id canceled all off base exercises save one  a six man cadet team and their drill out in the bush were missing three and the sergeant the cadets are in their eighth week of the cycle nobody here knows much about them up to and including their names but the sergeant	its not west is it tell me its not west
the exercise was one of his section eight private sessions left around 2100 yesterday and were scheduled for pick up at 0630 this morning	and the problem is you only got three
no the problem is ones dead ones got a bullet in his arm and one wont talk the one who wont talk was trading live fire with the dead one as we reached the pickup	im assuming thats what made him the dead one
which gives us about five hours whyd you call me	the guy in interrogation said hed only talk to a cop
tom bottom line i let those kids go out there if jag shows up and i dont have any answers for them my career is finished 	im not gonna let that happen
hes not done by a longshot i can get more out of him 	he can wait kendalls out of surgery
pike killed west dunbar killed mueller childs and nunez	who killed pike
weve already been over the terrain twice nothing	there was a hurricane bill the wind probably moved it
habeas corpus  you have to have a body to have a crime	okay then lets widen the search to include the endzone in giants stadium and the trunk of my car 
without the body we have no physical proof we need a confession	from dunbar i hate to break this to you but i dont think hes gonna be all that psyched to put himself in for the death penalty
nevertheless 	nevertheless what kendall will testify and thatll be enough
you mean not enough to save you	jag gets here in three hours try for the confession
tom where are you going 	home im done
you want a confession why dont you confess bill people are dead and you dont give a shit about it only reason you called me is to protect your fucking job you know this is your fault 	what the hell are you talking about 
yeah	does osborne agree
its over time of death was 442 jags been notified and i called the senator myself my report will reflect that his medical condition made this unavoidable you two had no culpability in the matter	thats horseshit and you know it
theyre taking your command arent they	the senator
im sorry bill	dont be im not cut out to deal with the wests of the world
youre a good soldier bill	i thought you said that wasnt a compliment
it was so good i actually forgot youre one of the bigger dogs now the base commander the one in control you couldnt let him testify could you	what are you talking about
if you let him testify then it would have all come out west was supposed to take care of it out there shut nunez up and then disappear but it got messy and people got killed so you called your old pal tom hardy figuring if worse came to worse hed cover for you	youre drunk 
stay where you are	or what youve gone round the bend 
what i cant understand is why you signed these if youd just let west take care of the paperwork no one would have known but you got careless so when pike finally told the truth you had to get rid of him too	thats preposterous 
toxicology report came back kendalls attack was caused by a drug known as anephadrine maybe youve heard of it its for asthmatics if an epileptic takes enough it kills them i checked with the nurses at the hospital  youre the only other person who visited kendall	i wanted to see if he was okay 
no more witnesses wests a ghost but it doesnt matter because we have your signature the hospital log and kendalls toxicology report and thatll be enough	youre crazy 
you cant duck this bill i may have done every goddamn thing in my life wrong but i wont let this happen	for the last time i have no idea what youre talking about 
hostile and uncooperative	fantastic you want to tell me whats going on
ah christ	you knew sergeant west
i didnt mean that as a compliment	sergeant wests served for twenty three years hes the public face of the modern army
gotta be honest i love what youve done with the place 	you and the colonel go back
he got me through basic and a lot of other stuff i owe him	youre the tom hardy ive been reading about in the papers right new orleans pd fired you for taking bribes from guissepe torres
it was for suspicion of bribery its really all in the wording 	wording and your friendship with the colonel aside im not comfortable having you involved in this
levi who names their kid levi 	senator jonathan kendall of ohio
christ remind me to thank bill for mentioning that on the phone 	kendall junior is still in surgery so he wont be available to answer for his name or anything else for another hour  the cadet were talking to first is dunbar
hes in interrogation	yes
move him	why
because interrogation rooms look suspiciously like interrogation rooms which doesnt exactly put people at ease is he cute	excuse me
is dunbar cute	that is the most unprofessional 
thank you at some point in there im gonna rub my nose when i do go at him with everything you got	good copbad cop
i questioned him for three hours and he didnt make a sound you dont have a badge he wont talk to you	ten bucks says i have him talking in under three minutes
the colonel saw you shoot nunez youre a murderer 	see ray this is what we call good cop bad cop she shouts i stand up for you youre grateful a bond of trust is established
baseball	i believe somebody owes me ten dollars 
you really want to make banal chit chat like that now	youre right we should sit in silence
were in the middle of a murder case 	best time for banal chitchat
what is that	microrecorder for kendall  didnt have time to wire his room now tell me why you joined the army or ill jab this pen through your neck
typical army brat story dad was noncom mom was a nurse there was never any real doubt of joining up	you had a mobile of bayonets above your crib
something like that you	i lost a bet
this is the straight hitting on me you were talking about isnt it	the very same
youre off to a late start	so noted
you guys really got the shit kicked out of you here	imagine what it must have been like for them out there what do you think of dunbar
something wrong	being back here gives me the willies
remember hes the son of a senator so go easy kid gloves	got it
that was kid gloves	have no fear osborne we have not yet begun to fight
but we have to question him   thought you didnt have cigarettes 	i lied wait for it
why the fuck wasnt he in restraints	i dont know
styles couldnt reassign him hes a legend 	you knew what he was capable of and you just stood by it was just a matter of time till somebody fragged his ass and you know what he deserved it theres your confession
west was a monster fifteen years ago i was here i was section eight i was pike fuck being the knife dummy  that thing he did stripping pike down making him stand outside all night he did that every year he did that to me fifteen years ago i wanted him dead and now im supposed to care that somebody offed him sorry no can do i tried	you did more than try you cracked dunbar in less than three minutes as an investigator youre phenomenal 
i was starting to believe you you know that you werent who everyone said i guess i was wrong 	oh spare me the reverse psychology bullshit this isnt my great second chance osborne everyone thinks im a piece of shit cop who took money and nothing is going to change that nobody will ever know what happens here 
why do you care	because its my job because people are dead because of the whole honor and duty thing make a difference in the world crap like that  we can do this hardy
i didnt shoot west	what
at least you and kendall agree on that	what happened next
dunbar	exactly someone whos not involved whos word cant be questioned you only let them see what you want them to see you make them believe so when the time comes theyve totally bought into your version of events
they believe the innocent are guilty and the guilty are innocent	and if theyre asked thats what theyll tell the world
so its a good plan but it goes wrong mueller flips out and shoots their fall guy which means they have to bring dunbar and kendall into the cover story 	kendall maybe would have agreed but the hurricane buttfucks the cabin 
buttfucks the cabin	and all hell breaks loose a lot of good guys shoot a lot of bad guys and whiz bang zoom happy ending
so why after dunbar drags kendall out from under a house does the senators son try and get us to put his savior in the gas chamber	that bugs you too
little bit	lets go talk to bill
were fucked i know 	they got their stories straight
are you sure	positive hardy they planned this
why dont you talk to levi off the record for a second	good idea
thats a fantastic idea 	see i just take your gun to the morgue and fire it into one of their skulls then i call every newspaper in the country with the story about how senator kendalls gay son went nuts on a training mission 
i pushed him too hard	you couldnt have known 
yeah i couldve shouldve	you wanted to get the truth
no i didnt i wanted to humiliate him for what he did to dunbar for fucking over the little guy	you mean the falsely accused
you wanted to break him	yeah
so what now	now i go home get drunk and try and forget this ever happened
think itll work	nah
you know you never told me why you left the army	it dawned on me one day that we were supposed to be a nation founded on the principle of questioning authority and all i did here was follow orders it didnt add up plus i got kicked out
for what	thats gonna stay my secret
we were close to something with kendall	maybe maybe we were nowhere near sometimes mysteries stay mysteries  i havent by any chance grown on you have i
no	good just making sure
we got maybe three minutes till they break it down	right back where we started
hardy what are you doing 	isnt this how your story goes
no bodies no west	no death certificates no crime
we need to talk 	seven
what	seven guys what was it you said you were just starting to believe i wasnt the guy people said
what if i dont want it	tough
thats not true	there are degrees of truth officer always degrees
youre a good man hardy	really
west	nobody saw but i dont think so
do i have a choice in this	yeah i can wait till youre off the base and do it myself
what are you doing out here	leaving without saying goodbye what are you gonna do
go home get drunk and try and forget this ever happened	think itll work
nah	want company
a word of advice about women  that first hour or so after they kill their boss probably not the best time to hit on them	i should probably write that down
he was your friend	yeah but he was a lot of other things too thanks
the thing is weve got a real opportunity here you turn me in tomorrow and were both fucked 	what are you talking about
how	mueller hes as bad as west and we both know it now i cant do it cause im tied up but we get the others to go along 
i dont think i want to hear this 	someone else can do the deed it doesnt have to be you maybe nunez too hes got a tendency to follow mueller but the rest of us can come out ahead  the guys who took out their sergeants killers well move the bodies out to the creek and say we came over the hill right as they fragged west all we gotta do is tell the story right
pike please 	although that wont matter much when coupled with the murder charge 
maybe we shouldnt go	the faggot speaks
you ever been in a hurricane mueller	you ever been in a hurricane mueller
we should tell him were not going	oh yeah excuse me sergeant sir we dont feel like going out  we dont want to get rained on hell kick our asses from here to cleveland
pike and i got separated 	yeah and he doesnt know when 
i remember now it was before the explosion 	oh you remember now 
i was freezing from the hurricane 	so you took off your shirt
we just want 	what the truth please there are degrees of truth officer always degrees things are not what they seem
he couldnt kick you out so he wanted you to quit on your own	he wanted more than that
he said what	youre gonna die tonight faggot clear as day
no one else heard it	he whispered it in my ear
nunez was chasing dunbar	because hed shot mueller
but you didnt see it right	like i said i was in the kitchen when i came out mueller and pike were dead nunez and childs were hit and dunbar was gone
pike never confessed	weve been making progress i see
running out of time are we tick tock ticktock how long till your witnesses fly the coop	fifty minutes
pike never confessed	no but it got you interested didnt it got you to dig inspired ray to tell you terribly sordid tales about drugs and creek beds and dead little sergeants who stuck their noses where they didnt belong
dunbar says you were	then hes mistaken you know i really dont think my father would approve of this line of questioning 
you and dunbar got your stories straight little details little inconsistencies designed to bounce us back from one of you to the other asking questions killing time until the transport arrives and whisks you away to where senator daddy can protect you you think youre just going to slide out of this youre an accessory to murder levi youre going to jail 	you cant threaten me 
it doesnt matter levi were going to find those bodies and when we do im going to make sure one of them has a bullet in them that matches your weapon 	what
it wont work 	it will and you know why because youre not a person anymore youre a cadet in the united states army you have no identity no miranda warning and no rights so im gonna throw you to the wolves and unlike you im gonna get away with it because youre pissing me off
enjoy your flight to washington 	wait 
who levi 	childs
i told him what had really happened to west told him to keep quiet about it or id destroy him because if it came out that i was involved with the whole px scam my father would be finished	i scared dunbar into silence hes been trying to cover for me the whole time we got here you came to see me i didnt know if i could trust him with that kind of secret 
what happened with nunez	he came after us and i told dunbar he had to kill him
hurricanes due after midnight and were still going out	toughens us up pike you dont like it quit
what the fuck happened to you 	what the fuck happened to you one minute youre next to me and the next youre gone and the sky lights up like fucking christmas 
whoever shot the sarge blew a grenade first 	blame the nigger then huh someone turns up dead you just look for the darkest face in the crowd 
i used it to start the fire 	still got mine on not a speck of blood on it not a bad trick for a murderer  you said you burned yours
goddammit ray we gotta get out of here 	were not going anywhere
cadet michael mueller i hereby place you under military arrest for the murder of sergeant nathan west 	the fuck are you talking about 
until we return to base and ballistics can match your weapon to the slugs in sergeant wests body 	shut up
tell him to shut up 	 failure to comply with this arrest is a court martialable offense in and of itself 
sign here and here  hey aint you the folks workin on that whole hulabaloo from last night	yeah
funny i swear i saw them bring him and the smaller guy in this morning	no no that was cadet dunbar 
so	maam ray dunbars black
this is totally unnecessary 	he asked to see a policeman were getting him a policeman
but this guy you called hes not even army 	hes former army and the best ive ever seen in a room besides he knows the territory we did basic together here  youve had three hours with dunbar and havent gotten a peep we need to take a different tack
hes not army its not official 	then its unofficial
what do you think	its too neat
you both know if you do this if you go after a senators son and youre wrong its not just me in the hot seat anymore	we know
you never told me why you got kicked out of	the army kicked you out for drugs
you motherfuckers have just made the worst mistake of your lives you have chosen to join my army this army is my mother my father and my little virgin sister and i will not allow anyone or anything that is not up to my standards near her pretty little virgin cooze do you understand me  give me a sir yes sir	sir yes sir
in my time i have killed sixteen men for the good of my country sixteen men whose entrance into this army i could not condone as it would weaken the fabric of this nations defense this base suffers an average of three training accidents a year unfortunate incidents that i will not hesitate to repeat if you cross me understand  give me a sir yes sir	sir yes sir
some of you may have heard theres a hurricane coming american soldiers do not wait for good weather  they do not wait for a bright sunshiney day to do their duty an american soldier learns to operate in the worst conditions and turn said conditions into an advantage against their enemy anyone who thinks these conditions are too harsh feel free to lay down and die you get me	sir yes sir
hey kid your friend just made himself a star	thats great
see the big guy likes it	i just saw the woman im going to marry i know it but then i lost her
tough break most men have to get married before they lose their wives	im going to spend the rest of my life looking for her that or die alone
jesus kid  let me guess real pretty blonde hair blue hat	yes
i know her uncle friends of the family	who is she where does she live
what do you mean you dont even know me	sure i do you were hot shit back in hickville but here in the real world you got squat you dont have a plan you dont have a job you dont have anything but the clothes on your back

can i see him	absolutely be good for you to talk to him
glad to see youre not trying to have a heartfelt talk its one of my greatest annoyances when people talk to those who cant hear them	my father and i have an advantage we never talk
how long have you known my father	thirty years maybe more
how would you describe him	fiveeleven oneeighty regulated hypertension  how would his son describe him
did your father ever tell you about the day you were born	a thousand times he caught an uncatchable fish
not that one the real story did he ever tell you that	no
did you see that woman	what did she look like
well she uh	was she nekkid
yeah	its not a woman its a fish no one ever catches her
im eight that means when im eighteen youll be 28 and when im 28 youll only be 38	youre pretty good at arithmetic
how are you gonna make it without your shoes	i suspect it will hurt a lot
you must be edward bloom	how did you know
no one would come out here unless they had business and no one would have business with me except for you youre buying the town	apparently ive overlooked this one piece of it and id like to remedy that you see in order for the town to be preserved the trust must own it in its entirety
in so many words yes	then i dont think so mr bloom if nothing is going to change id just as soon it not change in the way it hasnt been changing all this time
helping people makes me happy	im not convinced you should be happy
youre beamens daughter your last name is different  you married	i was 18 he was 28 turns out that was a big difference
i wont be selling you this house mr bloom	i see i thank you for your time
its okay just leave it	i can get it i can just
lord im sorry i	please go just go
ill	go
really	youre lucky to get four words out of them in english but if you were to walk through the jungle youd hear them speaking the most elaborate french those parrots talk about everything politics movies fashion  everything but religion
hi how are you feeling	i was dreaming
because see my mother was banging the milkman	no i understand
spooning the sherbet	can i take your picture
thats because we didnt have a wedding your motherinlaw was never supposed to marry me she was engaged to somebody else	i never knew
will never told you that  probably just as well he would have told it all wrong anyway all the facts and none of the flavor	oh so this is a tall tale
there was one time when i was eleven	you were talking about your wedding
i didnt forget i was just working on a tangent see most men theyll tell a story straight through and it wont be complicated but it wont be interesting either	i like your stories
wouldnt lie to you and theyve got allyoucaneat buffets you can eat a lot cant you	i can
youre just trying to get me to leave arent you thats why they sent you here	whats your name giant
karl	mines edward and truthfully i do want you to leave karl but i want to leave with you  you think this town is too small for you well its too small for a man of my ambition i cant see staying here a day longer
you dont like it	i love every square inch of it but i can feel the edges closing in on me a mans life can only grow to a certain size in a place like this  so what do you say join me
okay	okay
what did she say	beats me
you know anyones whos taken it	that poet norther winslow did he was going to paris france he must have liked it because no one ever heard from him again  tell you what you take the other way and ill cut through here meet you on the far side
youre not trying to run away	just to be sure you can take my pack
you can see my predicament my wedding ring the symbol of fidelity to my wife soon to be the mother of my child was now lost in the gut of an uncatchable fish	make him stop
jesus christ	friend of yours did you help him out of a bind
come on will everyone likes that story	no dad they dont i do not like the story not anymore not after a thousand times i know all the punchlines dad i can tell them as well as you can  for one night one night in your entire life the universe does not revolve around edward bloom it revolves around me and my wife how can you not understand that
the one about the witch	your mom says i cant tell you that one anymore you get nightmares
having a kid changes everything i mean theres the diapers and the burping and the midnight feedings	did you do any of that
no but i hear its terrible then you spend years trying to corrupt and mislead this child fill its head with nonsense and still it turns out perfectly fine	you think im up for it
people neednt worry so much its not my time yet this isnt how i go	really
truly i saw it in the eye	the old lady by the swamp
she was a witch	no she was old and probably senile maybe schizophrenic
and every day i gave him a quarter every day then i got sick and was out for a couple of weeks and when i went back there you know what he said	what did he say
you owe me threefifty	really
when did you ever work in an office	theres a lot you dont know about me
dad im hoping we can talk about some things while im here	you mean while im here
your mother hasnt been keeping up the pool if you wanted to you could	i will
you know where the chemicals are	i used to do it when you were gone remember i used to do it a lot
i thought you werent dying	i said this isnt how i go the last part is much more unusual trust me on that
why not religion dad	its rude to talk about religion you never know who youre going to offend
josephine actually went to the congo last year	oh so you know
but the real story is how i got the car you see	dad
son	can we talk
do you know much about icebergs dad	do i i saw an iceberg once they were hauling it down to texas for drinking water only they didnt count on an elephant being frozen inside the woolly kind a mammoth
dad	what
im trying to make a metaphor here	then you shouldnt have started with a question because people want to answer questions you should have started with the thing about icebergs is
i have no idea who you are because you have never told me a single fact	ive told you a thousand facts thats all i do will i tell stories
you tell lies dad you tell amusing lies stories are what you tell a fiveyear old at bedtime theyre not elaborate mythologies you maintain when your son is ten and fifteen and twenty and thirty and the thing is i believed you i believed your stories so much longer than i should have and then when i realized that everything you said was impossible  everything  i felt like such a fool to have trusted you you were like santa claus and the easter bunny combined just as charming and just as fake	you think im fake
dad im about to have a kid of my own here it would kill me if he went through his whole life never understanding me	it would kill you huh
what do you want will who do you want me to be	yourself good bad everything just show me who you are for once
the river	the river
tell me how it happens	how what happens
its unbelievable	story of my life
oh	but youre wrong i do know you at least by reputation edward bloom from ashton see im actually engaged to a boy from ashton don price he was a few years older than you
daffodils	theyre your favorite flower
how did you get so many	i called everywhere in five states and explained this was the only way i could get my wife to marry me
you dont even know me	i have the rest of my life to find out
how can i convince you to stop	go out with me
i was drying out	i see we need to get you one of those plant misters we can spray you like a fern
this is why you dont show work in progress	norther do you ever regret not making it to paris
i cant imagine any place better than here	youre a poet you oughta be able to and maybe if youd seen more you could
its me norther winslow	i was astonished to see the greatest poet of both ashton and spectre all the way out in texas
i dont believe it	i want you to know when you left spectre it opened my eyes there was a whole life out there that i was not living so i travelled i saw france and africa half of south america every day a new adventure thats my motto
so what are you up to now	im robbing this place
this is it the whole vault	fraid so
oh oh	hello
are you jenny hill	i am and youre will ive seen your picture thats how i recognize you i almost said something at the store but it would have been awkward  like this
how did you know my father	this was on his sales route so he was through here all the time everyone in town knew him
can i ask you a question why did you come here today if you found this deed why didnt you just ask eddie	because hes dying
look i dont know how much you want to know about any of this you have one image of your father and it would be wrong for me to go and change it especially this late in the game	my father talked about a lot of things he never did and im sure he did a lot of things he never talked about im just trying to reconcile the two
logically you couldnt be the witch because she was old back when he was young	no its logical if you think like your father see to him theres only two women your mother and everyone else
you didnt become crazy	well therapy and one day i realized i was in love with a man who could never love me back i was living in a fairy tale
thank you ill bet you need to 	yes
i spent a week in morocco for the story it was incredible	well have to pick up a copy
im going to get started on dishes	ill help you
im sorry it seems every hour i have to	i know it was the same when i was carrying will like clockwork
do you like it being pregnant	i do
you need to go	probably tonight
im going with you	you dont have to
i talked with your father last night	did you
you never told me how your parents met	they met at auburn
what about the details how they fell in love the circus the war you never told me any of that	thats because most of it never happened
mmm	mmm what
do you love your father	everyone loves my father hes a very likeable guy
you have to understand when i was growing up he was gone more than he was here and i started thinking  maybe he has a second life somewhere else with another house another family he leaves us he goes to them or maybe there is no family maybe he never wanted a family but whatever it is maybe he likes that second life better and the reason he tells all those stories is because he cant stand this boring place	but its not true
i need you on my side	i am always on your side and i think you should talk to him
what happened	your father had a stroke hes upstairs with your mom and dr bennett
ruth mchibbon offered to pick you up at the airport	we rented a car
is that dr bennetts car	hes up with your father
how much time does he have left	you dont talk about those things not yet
mom would you say you understand dad	of course
what i mean is do you really know whats going on in his head	yes
how is that possible i mean you try to ask him a question and suddenly its another one of his stories  you cant honestly say you know him	yes will i do and dont presume things you dont know
josephine and i have a lot in common	yes you both think william bloom is a very smart man  the problem is you only see me as your mother and not as someones wife and ive been his wife longer than ive been your mother you cant discount that
i know its not easy just remember he didnt choose to be your father and you didnt choose to be his son you just ended up together you could pick numbers out of a dark bag and itd be just the same if you ask me its a wonder parents and children can stand each other at all	but i understand you mom i always have
before i forget your father has papers in the basement id like you to go through i wouldnt know whats important	mom do you know who that is blonde hair
was she one of your teachers	no but its weird she seemed to recognize me
that really happened	not everything your father says is a complete fabrication
is he awake	he just fell asleep josephines with him
mom	yes
did you and dad have any other property	i suppose your grandmothers house when she passed on but we sold that right away your cousin shirley bought it
so you never bought any land	heavens no we had a hard enough time keeping the mortgage on this place

unless unless this is part of the routine you get tied up stick around distract me they both bust in and steal my cup of coffee	its makes it easier okay
i dont want to know	it makes it faster if i dont speak to the men they fall faster its pretty obvious why
so what are you going to do	im going to drink my coffee then were going to the police station where there will be lawyers loss of job house humiliation gutter press and probably prison
they dont blame you when a bank employee does this they understand you get your life back anyway i bet you hated that bank	even so i always felt the decision to burst in and rob it very much remained with me

would you like to be modified	had in mind something a little more radical
whats the problem	death
i want more life fucker	come here
the facts of life  ill be blunt to make an alteration in the evolvement of an organic life system at least by men makers or not it fatal  a coding sequence cant be revised once its established	why
because by the second day of incubation any cells that have undergone reversion mutation give rise to revertant colonies  like rats leaving a sinking ship  the ship sinks	what about ems recombination
then a repressor protein that blocks the operating cells	wouldnt obstruct replication but it does give rise to an error in replication so that the newly formed dna strand carries a mutation and youre got a virus again but all this is academic  you are made as good as we could make you
but not to last	put it this way  rolls royces are made to last  as least they were but im afraid youre a ferrari a high strung racing car  built to win not to last
also youre too valuable to experiment with	i am
ive done some questionable things	also extraordinary things
i like a man who stays put  an admirable thing to be able to sustain yourself in these times you live here all by yourself do you	well no not really  theres mr deetchum hes the watchman he lives on the first floor

six huh	five  three nights ago one of them managed to break into the tyrell corporation  killed two guards and got as far as the genetic sector before he got fried going through an electro field
what was he after	there wasnt much left of him so we cant be sure  but bio chemical data and morphology records of the nexus6 were reported missing  going on the possibility they might try to infiltrate we send holden in to run voightkampff tests on the new employees  guess he found himself one
the tyrell corporation has a demo model  check it out on the voightkampff  theres a chance the nexus6 is beyond out ability to detect  if thats the case everybodys up shit creek	what was the cover on the one that got holden
industrial refuse	garbage man
yeah	bryant here  regarding the rundown you requested on job applicants espers concluded that the only irregular category that tyrells got is the entertainment section  you better get on it

you start	the five in question are third generation nexus sixes constructed of skinflesh culture selected enogenic transfer conversion capable of selfperpetuating thought paraphysical abilities and developed for emigration program  are you with me
how do i stop one	unlike a five they can sustain massive traumas to several parts of the body without debilitating another  sever a leg and it will perform quicker on the remaining leg than the fastest man can run
okay but	im coming to that  vulnerable zone is the base of the skull the occipital bone  a direct hit is a positive retirement
heres something you might find interesting  they have been built to emulate the human in every way except in its emotional spectrum however after a period of time it is only logical that such a mechanism would create its own emotional responses hate love fear anger envy	i know all that
what about a summary then	i think were through for the night
yes	do you have something against science
not if it works	and what in your estimation works
four years  which would make her termination date	never mind  do they have that knowledge

i dont know	money is no object  hes got cards up the wazoo
youre serious arent you	whats that supposed to mean
it means that your taste in mens apparel is as bad as your taste in men	well thats blunt
im sorry but if the shoe fits	and i suppose you see him in some sort of strapless  thing dont you
i see elegant	yeah like ralph lauren
well what do you think	i thinkitworks
just be yourself	always good advice

whats that mean	we did not leave together
hey youre the psychic eve the psychic pimp  you tell me	those sluts
where are you going	to bed

in the first place i dont fall in love with weirdos ive only known for four or five days	yes you do
and i dont fall in love with grown men who collect baseball cards	uh yes you do
or pee in their pants when they see the ocean	yes you do
or have perfect table manners	you know i asked him about that and he said that good manners are a way we have of showing other people that we respect them see youd eat like a slob if you were alone but since another human being is present you show that person respect by going to the trouble of having proper manners i didnt know that i thought it was a way of appearing superior  know what else he told me
what	he thinks that i am a gentleman and that you are a lady
well consider the source i dont even know what a lady is	exactly i thought a gentleman was somebody who owned horses turns out the short and very simple definition of a gentleman or a lady is someone who always attempts to make the people around him or her feel as comfortable as possible thats it if you dont do that nothing else matters the cars the clothes the houses
where did he get all that information	from the oddest place his parents told him i dont think i got that memo
welli admit it im glad to hear that	he left with sophie

come on you brought it up do you know anything	i dont really know much but bits and pieces i hear things my room is right above my fathers office the ear theres no corpse in the morgue missing an ear and it did come off a living person thats direct from the coroners office the person is unknown there are a couple of cases i get mixed up on but i think there are some people who were brought in for questioning on a murder case that could have something to do with the ear i heard some of the same names
do you know who was brought in for questioning	there were at least three maybe four but a name that keeps coming up is this woman who lives in an apartment building very close to your house and also close to the field where you found the ear theres also a business man over by the franklin factory district that was questioned and a musician and some others
its a strange world isnt it do you know what building the woman lives in	yeah its close by thats whats creepy theyve had her under surveillance for a couple of months except i dont know what theyve found out because my father isnt in charge of her

well keep going roc	youll make it outta here you cant ever stop not ever
why have you come to a church for council if youre not religious	why have i come to a church i never have before i guess i just felt i should
what is it my son	its ethics i put evil men behind bars but the law has miles of red tape and loopholes for these cocksuckers to slip through ive found out there are these two young men who fix the situation with an iron fist as if they have gods permission but what they do is wrong and i should arrest them technically
but in this day and age i believe what they do is necessary i feel it is correct	you believe
yes	you feel a soul is what gives you feelings happiness guilt right or wrong it is a conduit through which the lord speaks to us you felt that your answers would be here in the house of god today you feel these men are necessary the lord has spoken to you twice this day
has he now	you have entered the house of the lord of your own free will speaking of beliefs and feelings is it so much to believe that god has brought you here
i guess not	it is easy to be sarcastic about religion it is harder to take small hints from god your feelings and listen to them to take a stand
youre right	those who do not act are in a constant state of ethical indecision
i want to stand for what i believe in father	then you must find out what your beliefs are
i believe these young men are right	you know them personally
yes	do you think they would harm an innocent man for any reason
the laws of god are higher than the laws of man	yes yes i was thinking that too no i was feeling it all i needed was to hear you say it amen ill help them
you gonna do what i say got it	yes
im sorry youre gonna hafta see this dont look at me	im sorry im sorry i didnt see

actually if you knew the exact route you could plant explosives under a manhole cover and blow it up as it went over	yeah but you wouldnt have the truck if you blew it up

see one day we were playing hot box over at my next door neighbor mr langstons house and anthony fell in the pool and got knocked unconscious i had to dive in and save him	this was in fourth grade
mr langston performed cardiopulmonary recitation cpr ive never said this before but frankly i thought anthony was dead the veins in his face were all sticking out his skin was blue he truly did look dead	after that my parents never let me go to dignans again
but if it wasnt for dignan i probably would of died	yes its true

you dont have to talk about it if you dont want to	no i dont mind
i know it must of been a bad experience but it doesnt sound like it was your fault	well i didnt mean to electrocute him but the whole operation was my idea
it took six months of research i did all the wiring myself switched ac to dc doubled the voltage shorted out the generator the whole school was shut down	thats pretty complicated for a senior prank
at first they were going to charge me with manslaughter thats partly why i was in custody so long sixty days	sixty days

ill say you killed his goddam girlfriend instead now theyre onto neski theyre at the brecker hotel even as we speak	will it track back to us
shes done everything i wanted she bit on conklin so fast it was laughable she even found his bogus swiss account	anything else
neski was a roadblock without me theres no company no fortune you owe me uri one last push	one last push one
leaving was a business decision were both rich come enjoy it	what do you mean
go to the airport get a plane ill have a brass band waiting for you	save it for bourne
he left yesterday on the night train hes probably just getting in now  youll have to hurry	bourne comes here why
treadstone	never heard of it
thats not gonna fly	with all due respect pam i think you mightve wandered a little past your paygrade
and what are we looking for	i want to know about treadstone
to know about it  it was a kill squad black on black closed down two years ago nobody wants to know about treadstone not around here  you better take this back to marty and make sure he knows what youre doing	he does ive been down to the archives i have the files ward
lets talk about conklin	what are you after pam you want to fry me you want my desk is that it
i want to know what happened	what happened jason bourne happened  youve got the files then lets cut the crap it went wrong conklin had these guys wound so tight they were bound to snap bourne was his number one  guy went out to work screwed the op and never came back conklin couldnt fix it couldnt find bourne couldnt adjust it all went sideways finally there were no options left
so you had conklin killed  i mean if were cutting the crap	ive given thirty years and two marriages to this agency ive shoveled shit on four continents im due to retire next year and believe me i need my pension but if you think im gonna sit here and let you dangle me with this you can go to hell marshall too  it had to be done
and bourne wheres he now	dead in a ditch drunk in a bar in mogadishu who knows
ivan mevedev  senior financial manager  worked for one of the new russian petroleum companies pecos oil he claimed to know where the money landed we believe this could have only happened with help from someone inside the agency this	this is conklins computer
at the time of his death conklin was sitting on a personal account in the amount of sevenhundred and sixty thousand dollars	do you know what his budget was
excuse me	we were throwing money at him throwing it at him and asking him to keep it dark
may i finish	conklin mightve been a nut but he wasnt a mole you have me his calendar for a couple of days ill prove he killed lincoln  this is supposed to be definitive
berlin	ive already got a team there i doubt bournes in naples to settle down and raise a family
you dont know what youre getting into here	and you do from the moment he left treadstone he has killed and eluded every person that you sent to find him
call a mayday into berlin station we need snipers dod whatever they got snipers	hold on  he said he wants to come in
my ass he does youre playing with fire pamela marshall said nail him to the wall i dont know how you interpreted that but i dont think he meant repatriate him	dont you want answers
sorry to wake you	i wasnt sleeping  you ok
what	they found danny zorns body dead in the basement at the building where my people got hit the first time
moscow what the hells he going to moscow for	dont know
jesus i zorn i have to call his family tell them	im sorry ward
sit down	id rather stand if its all the same to you
i dont exactly know what to say  im sorry	why would be enough for me
im not a traitor ive served my ountry	and pocketed a fair amount of change while doing it
had to be done	no good options left
in the end honestly its hubris simple hubris you reach a point in this game when the only satisfaction left is to see how clever you are	no you lost your way
i did my box work but i wanted to show you before i showed landy i came out here last night because none of this was making any sense i mean im with you on this conklin was a nut but a traitor i just cant get there	what do you have danny
you put a fourgam kel on here and its gonna take out power to the building you know that what you cant know is if its gonna blow the room with it	and
there were two charges they were supposed to go off simultaneously the second one the one that didnt go off was down here  first of all this is nothing its a subline for the breaker above second why put the charge all the way down here if youre good enough to get in here and handle the gear youre good enough to know you dont need this  bourne would know	it was staged
is it a slam dunk no but	jesus
okay what if someone decided to cover their tracks by blaming conklin and bourne what if bourne didnt have anything to do with this	keep going
somethings been going on here in europe and its still going on post conklin whos been in berlin	lots of people
show me again	okay 
of all the people in the world youre the only one i have anything to offer  thats why i came here	okay
its nice  does this picture mean anything to you  hmm	its nothing its just a picture
no its because you dont know how they died	no i do
i would want to know  i would want to know that my mother didnt kill my father i would want to know that she didnt kill herself	what
it changes things that knowledge doesnt it	yes
it was my job my first time your father was supposed to be alone but then your mother she came out of nowhere  i had to change my plan  you understand me  you dont have to live like that anymore thinking that	you killed them
they loved you  and i killed them	how how can how can you be here and say this
it doesnt matter your life is hard enough	youre a liar
you know im not	youre a liar
i emptied it	felt a little light
front use your teeth	sorry old habits
so why didnt you kill me then	she wouldnt let me  shes the only reason youre alive
try again	shot dead in paris dead the night you walked out
youre lying if its over why are they after me	i dont know
whats going on in berlin	i dont know why would i lie
she really did that told you not to kill me  i had a woman once but after a while what do you talk about i mean for us the work you cant tell them who you are	i did
you called it in	im sorry
 car keys	 my coat  but we should 
 what 	 take the back  get another car 
where were you jason in the car	conklin up front
youre sure  we should still  we should write it down	two years were scribbling in a notebook 
 it hasnt been two years 	 its always bad and its never anything but bits and pieces anyway  you ever think that maybe its just making it worse you dont wonder that
im trying marie okay	i worry when you get like this
sleep sleep now	i should be better by now
you are better and i think its not memories at all its just a dream you keep having over and over	but it ends up the same
no how	the telegraph office
but we were so careful	we pushed it we got lazy
but youre sure	he was at the campground yesterday
so	its wrong guy with a rental car and hundred dollar sneakers sleeps in a tent
but youre not  youre not sure	we cant wait to be sure
i dont want to move again i like it here	look we clear out we get to the shack we get safe we hang there awhile ill come back ill check it out but right now we cant 
you drive	what
switch you drive	 where 
jesus    is he back there 	 not yet 
you keep going to the shack ill meet you there in an hour	where are you going
im going to bail on the other side and wait this bridge is the only way he can follow	what if its not who you think it is
i warned them marie i told them to leave us alone	jason please dont do thisit wont ever be over like this
i love you too	tell me later
i wanted to kill him	but you found another choice
i know its a dream	you do
i did jason i swear i did i told them i told them i believed you	who is pamela landy
why is she trying to kill me	they know  they know you were here they know you killed these two guys they know you and conklin had something on the side they dont know what it is but they know
say it	last week an agency field officer went to make a buy from a russian national
a russian	it was pamela landys op the guy was going to sellout a mole or something i havent been debriefed on exactly what it was
and you got to him before we could	i killed him
you left a print there was kel that didnt go off there was a partial print they tracked it back to treadstone they know its you	i left a fingerprint you fucking people
what was landy buying what kind of files  what was she buying	conklin stuff on conklin 
why are you here then	please  im only here because of paris  because they cant figure out what youre doing  im here because of abbott 
for treadstone in berlin you know my file i did a job here when	no you never worked berlin
my first job	your first assignment was geneva
no jason please	i was here
its me	bourne
what do you want	i want to come in
okay how do you want to do it	i want someone i know to take me in
who	there was a girl in paris part of the program she used to handle the medication
okay jason your move	alexanderplatz 30 minutes under the world clock alone give her your phone
why am i alive	are you disappointed
thank you for your gift im sorry about marie	whats that
you didnt answer my question	why youre alive  youre alive because youre special because she kept you alive  because we want you back on our side
 so there were two of these explosive charges placed on the power lines one of them failed the fingerprint  thats from the one that didnt go off	and the germans cant match it
looks like hes been detained	whos going us
theres only a consulate they sent a field officer out half an hour ago 	then get a number they need to know who theyre dealing with
 kurts reopening all the wyfi and sat links 	 uplink all relevant files to kim    and i want them to contact anyone who had anything to do with treadstone 
 go  take the van 	 the hotel  how far 
maybe he just needed a place to spend the night	i want to look at the room  check it out
alright take it down	what
well know for sure when we get the security tapes	but we can relax we tracked him hes on a train to moscow
youre sure	what the tapes
show me	here
this is everything is there	is there is all there
im here so is donnie and jack weller we understand youre using the full allocation for this buy	thats where we came out
its a lot of money pam	were talking raw unprocessed kgb files its not something we can go out and comparison shop
still	for a thief a mole i vetted the source marty hes real if it does nothing more than narrow the list of suspects its a bargain at ten times the price
okay cut to the chase pam what are you selling	i think that bourne and conklin were in business that bourne is still involved and that whatever information i was going to buy in berlin it was big enough to make bourne come out from wherever hes been hiding to kill again  hows that scan
mr nevins	whos this
how long have you worked for the agency	me four years
what kind of problems	depression anger compulsive behaviors they had physical symptoms  headaches  sensitivity to light 
amnesia	before this before bourne no
im curious about bourne your interpretation of his condition you have specific training in the identification and diagnosis of psychological conditions	am i a doctor no but
are you an expert in amnesia	look what do you want me to say i was there i believed him
so he fooled you	if you say so
not good enough youre the person who floated this amnesia story  ever feel sorry for him for what hed been through	youre making it out like were friends here or something i met him alone twice
did you	these were killers conklin had them all jacked up they were dobermans
some women like dobermans 	what do you want from me i was reassigned im out
i dont think we need to keep looking for him anyway	and why is that
is it fresh	its got caffeine in it thats all i know
lets give him half an hour	so
do we know what this says	yup  the main word there the file heading translates as treadstone
anything	no munichs a bust hes loose
black coat possibly leather dark slacks dark tshirt  he says theyre gonna try and corral the guests on the street over there and then check them out but	yeah thatll workwhat the hell was he doing here
heres what ive got  remember vladimir neski russian politician seven years ago he was due to speak to a group of european oil ministers here at the hotel he never did he was murdered	by who
his wife in room 645 then she shot herself 	alright i want you kurt and kim to stay on bourne track everything thats out there
were looking at all berlin outbound good news is every train station in berlin has thirty to forty fixed digital security cameras common feed	are we hacking or asking
yes in that order	and what about you anything
someone dead from this household	we just had a funeral isnt that what it means in england as well
then well just have a peek at the wounds  dig em up	theyve been sanctified and buried in the holy rites of gods church and any hand that disturbs them now takes on eternal damnation so please  do it
did the priest say anything about the resurrection or was it all about judgment	it was in latin sir
with cavalry  not heavy like the english but light fast horsemen like you nobles employ  we could outmaneuver their bowmen	it is suicide
sir william we come to seek a meeting	youve all sworn to longshanks
an oath to a liar is no oath at all an oath to a patriot is a vow indeed every man of us is ready to swear loyalty to you	so let the council swear publicly
i will meet you but only one way  if robert the bruce is there and puts his hand on my bible and swears his loyalty to scotland	he has already agreed to come
young robert we are honored 	my father hears that longshanks has granted prima noctes
a wise plan and how is your father we have missed him at the council	he strained his leg so that it pains him to ride but he sends his greetings  and says that i speak for all the bruces and for scotland
does anyone know his politics	no but his weight with the commoners could unbalance everything the balliols will kiss his ass so we must
if i pay homage to anothers throne then how am i a king	homage is nothing it is the crown that matters
the crown is that of scotland and scotland is william wallace	that is another matter there is a price to all this required both by longshanks and our nobles pay it and you will be our king and we will have peace
he wont come	he will i know he will
longshanks promised	you are surprised he would lie balliol was murdered in a church yesterday you are longshanks new designate you will be king
scottish rebels have routed lord bottoms	i hear this wallace is a bandit nothing more
what news of the north	nothing new majesty we have sent riders to speed any word
while i am in france fighting to expand your future kingdom i learn that stirling castle is lost our entire northern army wiped out and you have done nothing	i have ordered conscriptions
wallace has sacked york	impossible  how dare you bring a panicky lie
the weapon has been outlawed by the pope himself	so the scots will have none of them will they my armorers have already made a thousand
now we kill two birds at one stroke we recruit from scotland for our armies in france	the scots will fight for us
his legend grows it will be worse than before	you let wallace escape your whole army you cannot blame me for this
what is it	you directed me to report to you the moment the kings conference was ended
so i did and what was so important about it	scotland he intends 
shut up would you how can i concentrate	his majesty was quite keen that you should understand 
no mlord	look at me i said look at me
now my flower do you understand	yes i had thought that i was loathsome to you perhaps i am if i may be excused mlord
good day to you mlords	you mock us with a smile
i am cheerful with a plan to soothe your miseries all of england shudders with the news of renewed rebellion	wallaces followers
the little cow is insane 	grant as you do everything else with treachery offer him a truce to discuss terms and send me to my castle at locharmbie as your emissary he trusts me pick thirty of your finest assassins for me to take along and i will set the meeting and the ambush
is it true wallace is captured	simply because he eluded your trap do you think he is more than a man my father is dying perhaps you should think of our coronation
i have come to beg for the life of william wallace	you fancy him
ill wait back there	hamish i thank
we make spears a hundred spears fourteen feet long	fourteen 
the bruce is not coming william	mornay has come so will the bruce
stephen ready	aye
rest william	i rest
you know its a trap	probably but we cant win alone we know that this is the only way
i dont want to be a martyr	nor i i want to live i want a home and children and peace ive asked god for those things but hes brought me this sword and if he wills that i must lay it down to have what he wants for my country then ill do that too
thats just a dream william	weve lived a dream together a dream of freedom
your dreams arent about freedom theyre about marion you have to be a hero because you think she sees you is that it	my dreams of marion are gone i killed them myself if i knew i could live with her on the other side of death id welcome it
keep these were going too	no one of us is enough
theyre coming	how many
theyre english soldiers aint they	with your father and brother gone theyll kill us and burn the farm
wanna stay with me tonight	i wanna have supper waitin
test of manhood	you win
i still say this is no test a catapult can throw a stone farther than a man can	that depends on the man
youll move	i will not
good to see you again	i shoulda remembered the eggs
all right father ill ask him  if i risk my neck for you will i get a chance to kill englishmen	is your poppa a ghost  or do you converse with god almighty
excellent stephen is my name im the most wanted man on the emerald isle except im not on the emerald isle of course mores the pity	a common thief
we must run in different directions	we dont split up
i am the one who is rotting but i think your face looks graver than mine	he was so brave with courage alone he nearly won
so more men were slaughtered uselessly	he broke because of me i saw it he lost all will to fight
we must have alliance with england to prevail here you achieved that you saved your family increased your lands in time you will have all the power in scotland yet you grieve	in my heart i had begun to hope that he would never break
where is my son	your pardon mlord he asked me to come in his stead
i sent for him  and the little coward send you	shall i leave mlord
then why does he stay my scouts say he has not advanced	he waits for you he says he will attack no more towns  if you are man enough to come fight him
the scottish nobles have sent him no support his army starves our stall has worked he must withdraw you may return to your embroidery	humbly mlord
forgive me sire i thought that generosity might demonstrate your greatness to those you mean to rule	my greatness is better demonstrated with this
i have faced him have you	let her speak
treason against whom	against thy king thou vile fool hast thou anything to say
i do not confess	then on the morrow thou shalt receive they purification and in the end i promise youll beg for the axe
thank you for accepting	thank you for inviting
ill invite you again but your mother thinks im crazy	you are and ill come again
did it work	no you dont choose your dreams your dreams choose you
i want to marry you	i accept your proposal
but i wont give you up to any nobleman	you scare me
i dont want to scare you i want to be yours and you mine every night like this one	this night is too beautiful to have again
ive missed you	shush its only been a day  and its seemed like forever
tonight then	my parents are growing suspicious i cant keep meeting you every night
then when	tonight
i need you so much i love you	wake up william wake up
when the king returns he will bury them in those new clothes scotland is in chaos your husband is secretly sending an army north	how do you know this
this scottish rebel wallace he fights to avenge a woman	a magistrate wished to capture him and found he had a secret lover so he cut the girls throat to tempt wallace to fight  and fight he did
knowing his passion for his lost love they next plotted to take him by desecrating the graves of his father and brother and setting an ambush at the grave of his wife he fought his way through the trap and carried her body to a secret place now that is romance oui	i wouldnt know
i am the princess of wales	wife of edward the kings son
i come as the kings servant and with his authority	its battle i want not talk
i understand that you have recently been given the rank of knight	i have been given nothing god makes men what they are
did god make you the sacker of peaceful cities the executioner of the kings nephew my husbands own cousin	york was the staging point for every invasion of my country and that royal cousin hanged a hundred scots even women and children from the city walls
let us talk plainly you invade england but you cannot complete the conquest so far from your shelter and supply the king proposes that you withdraw your attack in return he grants you title estates and this chest with a thousand pounds of gold which i am to pay to you personally	a lordship and gold that i should become judas
peace is made is such ways	slaves are made in such ways
you understand consider before you laugh and say no you will never own a throne though you deserve one but just as the sun will rise tomorrow some man will rule england and what if his veins ran not with the blood of longshanks but with that of a true king	i cannot love you for the sake of revenge
mlady what kindness of you to visit a stranger	sir i come to beg you to confess all and swear allegiance to the king that he might show you mercy
will he show mercy to my country will he take back his soldiers and let us rule ourselves	mercy is to die quickly perhaps even live in the tower in time who knows what can happen if you can only live
you will die it will be awful	every man dies not every man really lives
drink this it will dull your pain	it will numb my wits and i must have them all if im senseless or if i wail then longshanks will have broken me
wait i respect what you said but remember these men have lands castles much to risk	and the common man who bleeds on the battlefield does he risk less
no but from top to bottom this country has no sense of itself its nobles share allegiance with england and its clans war with each other if you make enemies on both sides of the border youll end up dead	we all end up dead its only a question of how and why
im no coward i want what you want but we need the nobles	nobles what does that mean  to be noble your title gives you claim to the throne of our country but men dont follow titles they follow courage your arm speaks louder than your tongue our people know you noble and common they respect you if you would lead them toward freedom they would follow you and so would i
war finds me willing i know it wont bring back all i have lost but it can bring what none of us have ever had  a country of our own for that we need a king we need you	i am trying
then tell me what a king is is he a man who believes only what others believe is he one who calculates the numbers for and against him but never weighs the strength in your own heart there is strength in you i see it i know it	i must consult with my father
whats the crazy man saying lord	the dogs have a scent my scent someone must have given it to them
who would do such a thing	exactly
fine speech now what do we do	bring out our spearmen and set them in the field
mrs treborn i need to speak with you	im sorry but can it wait til tonight im already late for work 
i was going to show this to the principal but i wanted to talk to you first	what is it
thank you for showing it to me first ill ill take care of it can i have the picture	of course there is one more thing mrs treborn and i feel bad for mentioning it
what	when i asked evan about his drawing well he didnt remember doing it
and you say he doesnt remember any of it	not according to his teacher it just got me thinking about jason and what if evans inherited his fathers condition
just tell me that evan doesnt have jasons illness	look andrea im sure hell test negative for brain disorders but theres something else you can try to monitor his memory
anything	a journal just have him write down everything he does
why what for	it could be extremely useful to jog his memory see if he remembers anything new the next day and ill have the test results back in a few days
well the good news is that the results are negative ive found no evidence in the way of lesions hemorrhaging tumors	and the bad news
unfortunately weve got nothing to work with its harder playing detective now	but you must have something to go on
if i had to guess id say the blackouts are stress related	but hes seven what kind of stress can he have
plenty who knows maybe hes got severe coping problems about not having a father did you say the last blackout occurred when he was with his friends dad	come on i doubt the answers that simple
youd be surprised how often they are	well he has been pushing me to meet his father but ive been putting it off
evan wake up oh please wake up	nine ten and youre awake open your eyes dammit
actually these tests werent available twenty years ago	so what did you find
no dances just tell me	the hemorrhaging the neural damage is irreparable im frankly surprised he still has use of his motor functions
rightytighty leftylucy	thanks dont worry evan youll have plenty of time
you know the answer to that	cant he come out for one day
weve been over this a hundred times its too dangerous for him	but lenny said that his dads coming and tommy and kayleighs dad
all the dads are gonna be there	i get the point kiddo but im not so bad am i
no	good because ive been waiting to see your art projects all week and id feel terrible if all you thought about was your father not being there
i dont like this place mom its creepy please can we go i promise i wont make any more bad pictures	youll be fine dr redfield just wants to give you some tests youll like him
thats why i wanted you to come here evan dr redfield already has a background in memory loss	my father has a bad memory too
thesell bring you luck crockett	great ill see you soon
what happened	honey what were you doing with that
now your father may seem sleepy to you but thats just because of his medicine okay	okay
i dont know i dont remember	something mustve happened what set him off
please mom people will talk	i cant help it im just so proud of you youve got the highest grades in all of your classes
did da  jason  get good grades	please he got straight as without ever touching a book that was the one area where his memory never failed him
why do you ask	no its just weird with him being such a brain and all i just wondered if he was ever able to remember stuff hed forgotten
and then just before it got so bad that he had to be committed he said that he could	what what could he do
i spoke to your new lawyer about the appeal hes sure he can get you off on selfdefense so if youre patient	how long will i be in here
i dont know these things take time	hows kayleigh doing she all right
i found these the others are still in storage	damn it mom i told you i need them all
okay doc whats the damage how much time have i got	cute evan
what does that mean for evan	hes saying its like forty years worth of new memories have been jammed in my brain since last year overload city sat about the gist of it doc
there must be a way to fix this	fix
just like jason	dont worry im gonna get you out of here
best not bitch up wind up someones luggage that way	can you protect me
youre religious carlos you believe that bit about the lord works in mysterious ways	straight up
because i think he sent me to your cell on purpose for you to help me	shit i knew you were crazy
so when im out i need you to watch my face and hands closely	you need to see the prison shrink man
what did you see what did it look like	signs of the lord they just appeared out of nowhere i thought you were loco
hello evan its very nice to meet you  hes as handsome as his father	you know my father
dad lives here	not in this wing actually no
now i want you to go back to the time you were in the woods with lenny think of it like a movie you can pause rewind or slow down any details you wish understand	yes
where are you now	im standing next to kayleigh my hands are over her ears
are you hurting her	no protecting her
okay then go a little forward in time what do you see now	i see a car
go on nothing can hurt you remember this is only a movie youre completely safe	i cant the car vanishes and all of a sudden im on the ground in the woods
the car doesnt vanish evan the movie in your head has broken thats all but now ive respliced it and i want you to tell me about the car	its coming argh i cant
its a little complicated i havent seen results exactly like these before	are you sure not even with my father
this is where were finding most of the hemorrhaging the outer lining of the cerebral cortex	lemme guess would that be where the memories are stored
hey evan whats the big rush we dont meet for another hour	where are my goddamn books
get dressed thumper youre taking me out for my birthday	i thought you were a december baby
its an experiment with flatworms and a maze you take a flatworm and run it through the maze until hes memorized it then you put a new flatworm in the maze hes clueless banging into walls getting lost whatever	like ozzy
just by absorbing the first worm into its cellular structure it gets all of the worms memories	thats probably why hannibal lecters so smart
you really think he wanted to kill you	all i know is that i might be able to unblock some of my repressed memories
are you stupid or what	what
whasamatter lost your rolex	huh
get out both of you	sorry dude just figured itd be okay with you bein sick and all
we should go soon if dad catches us smoking down here were dead	so lets go this place creeps me out

i dont understand where are you taking me	youll see
why are you doing all this for me	simple math when i woke up this morning and saw your smile i knew that i wanted to spend the rest of my life with you
its my fault i should have told you he was released a few weeks ago	mighta been nice  like this is gonna do any good maybe one of the frat guys has a gun

i should have known	my husband is with me too
no of course not do you mind if i do	no
no i mean is he trustworthy is his word 	 now just a minute who told you to ask me that
he did captain renault did	i thought so wheres your husband
so you decided to go to america	yes but we have not much money and traveling is so expensive and difficult it was much more than we thought to get here and then captain renault sees us and he is so kind he wants to help us
yes ill bet	he tells me he can give us an exit visa but we have no money
does he know that	oh yes
and he is still willing to give you a visa	yes monsieur
and you want to know 	 will he keep his word
nobody ever loved me that much	and he never knew and the girl kept this bad thing locked in her heart that would be all right wouldnt it
you want my advice	oh yes please
go back to bulgaria	oh but if you knew what it means to us to leave europe to get to america oh but if jan should find out he is such a boy in many ways i am so much older than he is
monsieur rick i 	 hes just a lucky guy
you will find a market there for this ring i am forced to sell it at a great sacrifice	thank you but i hardly think 
good	what is your name
mr berger the ring could i see it again	yes monsieur
i recognize you from the news photographs monsieur laszlo	in a concentration camp one is apt to lose a little weight
we read five times that you were killed in five different places	as you see it was true every single time thank heaven i found you berger i am looking for a man by the name of ugarte he is supposed to help me
monsieur rick may i get you a cup of coffee	no thanks carl

the bourbon  the news about ugarte upset me very much	youre a fat hypocrite you dont feel any sorrier for ugarte than i do
of course not what upsets me is the fact that ugarte is dead and no one knows where those letters of transit are	practically no one
if i could lay my hands on those letters i could make a fortune	so could i and im a poor businessman
i have a proposition for whoever has those letters i will handle the entire transaction get rid of the letters take all the risk for a small percentage	and the carrying charges
rick ill put my cards on the table i think you know where those letters are	well youre in good company renault and strasser probably think so too
thats why i came over here to give them a chance to ransack my place	rick dont be a fool take me into your confidence you need a partner
ah to get out of casablanca and go to america youre a lucky man	oh by the way my agreement with sams always been that he gets twenty five percent of the profits that still goes
hmmm i happen to know that he gets ten percent but hes worth twenty five	and abdul and carl and sacha they stay with the place or i dont sell
of course they stay ricks wouldnt be ricks without them	well so long
dont forget you owe ricks a hundred cartons of american cigarettes	i shall remember to pay it to myself
i will stay here and keep on trying im sure in a little while 	 we might as well be frank monsieur it will take a miracle to get you out of casablanca and the germans have outlawed miracles
weve decided signor ferrari for the present well go on looking for two exit visas thank you very much	well good luck but be careful  you know youre being shadowed
i observe that you in one respect are a very fortunate man monsieur i am moved to make one more suggestion why i do not know because it cannot possibly profit me but have you heard about signor ugarte and the letters of transit	yes something
it was gracious of you to share it with me good day mademoiselle monsieur	good day
and mademoiselle	you neednt be concerned about me
mademoiselle after this disturbance it is not safe for laszlo to stay in casablanca	this morning you implied it was not safe for him to leave casablanca
uh huh under a safe conduct from me	what value is that you may recall what german guarantees have been worth in the past
there are only two other alternatives for him	what are they
not an easy day to forget	no
say goodnight to sam for me	i will

no no not at my hotel i uh i have things to do in the city before i leave ill meet you at the station huh	all right at a quarter to five  say why dont we get married in marseilles
thats too far ahead to plan	yes i guess it is a little too far ahead well lets see what about the engineer why cant he marry us on the train
well why not the captain on a ship can it doesnt seem fair that hey hey whats wrong kid	i love you so much and i hate this war so much oh its a crazy world anything can happen if you shouldnt get away i mean if if something should keep us apart wherever they put you and wherever ill be i want you to know
oh i saved my first drink to have with you here	no no rick not tonight
please	why did you have to come to casablanca there are other places
i wouldnt have come if i had known that you were here believe me rick its true i didnt know	its funny about your voice how it hasnt changed i can still hear it richard dear ill go with you any place well get on a train together and never stop
please dont dont rick i can understand how you feel	huh you understand how i feel how long was it we had honey
i didnt count the days	well i did every one of them mostly i remember the last one a wow finish a guy standing on a station platform in the rain with a comical look on his face because his insides had been kicked out
can i tell you a story rick	has it got a wow finish
i dont know the finish yet	well go on tell it maybe one will come to you as you go along
its about a girl who had just come to paris from her home in oslo at the house of some friends she met a man about whom shed heard her whole life a very great and courageous man he opened up for her a whole beautiful world full of knowledge and thoughts and ideals everything she knew or ever became was because of him and she looked up to him and worshipped him with a feeling she supposed was love	yes thats very pretty i heard a story once as a matter of fact ive heard a lot of stories in my time they went along with the sound of a tinny piano playing in the parlor downstairs mister i met a man once when i was a kid itd always begin huh i guess neither one of our stories was very funny tell me who was it you left me for was it laszlo or were there others in between or arent you the kind that tells
im sorry i was in no condition to receive you when you called on me last night	it doesnt matter
why did you come back to tell me why you ran out on me at the railway station	yes
well you can tell me now im reasonably sober	i dont think i will rick
why not after all i got stuck with a railway ticket i think im entitled to know	last night i saw what has happened to you the rick i knew in paris i could tell him hed understand but the one who looked at me with such hatred well ill be leaving casablanca soon and well never see each other again we knew very little about each other when we were in love in paris if we leave it that way maybe well remember those days and not casablanca not last night
did you run out on me because you couldnt take it because you knew what it would be like hiding from the police running away all the time	you can believe that if you want to
all the same someday youll lie to laszlo youll be there	no rick no you see victor laszlo is my husband and was even when i knew you in paris
how did you get in	the stairs from the street
i told you this morning youd come around but this is a little ahead of schedule well wont you sit down	richard i had to see you
you use richard again were back in paris	please
your unexpected visit isnt connected by any chance with the letters of transit it seems that as long as i have those letters ill never be lonely	you can ask any price you want but you must give me those letters
i went through all that with your husband its no deal	i know how you feel about me but im asking you to put your feelings aside for something more important
do i have to hear again what a great man your husband is what an important cause hes fighting for	it was your cause too in your own way you were fighting for the same thing
no oh richard im sorry im sorry but but you you are our last hope if you dont help us victor laszlo will die in casablanca	what of it im going to die in casablanca its a good spot for it
 all right i tried to reason with you i tried everything now i want those letters get them for me	i dont have to ive got them right here
put them on the table	no
for the last time put them on the table	if laszlo and the cause mean so much to you you wont stop at anything all right ill make it easier for you
and then	it wasnt long after we were married that victor went back to czechoslovakia they needed him in prague but there the gestapo were waiting for him just a twoline item in the paper victor laszlo apprehended sent to concentration camp i was frantic for months i tried to get word then it came he was dead shot trying to escape i was lonely i had nothing not even hope then i met you
oh it wasnt my secret richard victor wanted it that way not even our closest friends knew about our marriage that was his way of protecting me i knew so much about his work and if the gestapo found out i was his wife it would be dangerous for me and for those working with me	when did you first find out he was alive
just before you and i were to leave paris together a friend came and told me that victor was alive they were hiding him in a freight car on the outskirts of paris he was sick he needed me i wanted to tell you but i i didnt care i knew i knew you wouldnt have left paris and the gestapo would have caught you so i well well you know the rest	huh but its still a story without an ending what about now
now i dont know i know that ill never have the strength to leave you again	and laszlo
i cant fight it anymore i ran away from you once i cant do it again oh i dont know whats right any longer youll have to think for both of us for all of us	all right i will heres looking at you kid
richard victor thinks im leaving with him havent you told him	no not yet
but its all right isnt it you were able to arrange everything	everything is quite all right
i dont understand what about you	im staying here with him til the plane gets safely away
no richard no what has happened to you last night we said 	 last night we said a great many things you said i was to do the thinking for both of us well ive done a lot of it since then and it all adds up to one thing youre getting on that plane with victor where you belong
but richard no i i 	 youve got to listen to me do you have any idea what youd have to look forward to if you stayed here nine chances out of ten wed both wind up in a concentration camp isnt that true louis
im saying it because its true inside of us we both know you belong with victor youre part of his work the thing that keeps him going if that plane leaves the ground and youre not with him youll regret it	no
maybe not today maybe not tomorrow but soon and for the rest of your life	but what about us
well always have paris we didnt have wed lost it until you came to casablanca we got it back last night	and i said i would never leave you
yes	she tried everything to get them and nothing worked she did her best to convince me that she was still in love with me but that was all over long ago for your sake she pretended it wasnt and i let her pretend
hello sam	hello miss ilsa i never expected to see you again
its been a long time	yes maam a lot of water under the bridge
some of the old songs sam	yes maam
where is rick	i dont know i aint seen him all night
does he always leave so early	oh he never well  hes got a girl up at the blue parrot he goes up there all the time
you used to be a much better liar sam	leave him alone miss ilsa youre bad luck to him
play it once sam for old times sake	i dont know what you mean miss ilsa
play it sam play as time goes by	oh i cant remember it miss ilsa im a little rusty on it
victor i i feel somehow we shouldnt stay here	if we would walk out so soon it would only call attention to us perhaps ugartes in some other part of the cafe
you are very kind	wont you join us
this time they really mean to stop me	victor im afraid for you
goodnight	goodnight
we are only interested in two visas signor	please ilsa dont be hasty
no ilsa i wont let you stay here you must get to america and believe me somehow i will get out and join you	but victor if the situation were different if i had to stay and there were only a visa for one would you take it
yes i see when i had trouble getting out of lille why didnt you leave me there and when i was sick in marseilles and held you up for two weeks and you were in danger every minute of the time why didnt you leave me then	i meant to but something always held me up i love you very much ilsa
he does could we have a table close to him	and as far away from major strasser as possible
what happened with rick	well discuss it later
our faithful friend is still there	victor please dont go to the underground meeting tonight
yes	but no intention of selling them one would think if sentiment wouldnt persuade him money would
did he give any reason	he suggested i ask you
yes victor i was	i know how it is to be lonely  is there anything you wish to tell me
no victor there isnt	i love you very much my dear
be careful	of course ill be careful
are you ready ilsa	yes im ready  goodbye rick god bless you
captain the boy who is playing the piano somewhere i have seen him	sam
yes	he came from paris with rick
rick whos he	mademoiselle you are in ricks and rick is 
 is what	well mademoiselle hes the kind of a man that well if i were a woman and i  were not around i should be in love with rick but what a fool i am talking to a beautiful woman about another man
hello rick	oh youve already met rick mademoiselle
well then perhaps you also 	 this is mr laszlo
i cant get over you two she was asking about you earlier rick in a way that made me extremely jealous	i wasnt sure you were the same lets see the last time we met 
im afraid major strasser would insist	youre saying this only to make me go
how do you do	how do you do
one hears a great deal about rick in casablanca	and about victor laszlo everywhere
your work	thank you i try
well come again	any time
good morning	signor ferrari is the fat gent at the table
monsieur blaine i wonder if i could talk to you	go ahead
you must know its very important i get out of casablanca its my privilege to be one of the leaders of a great movement you know what i have been doing you know what it means to the work to the lives of thousands and thousands of people that i be free to reach america and continue my work	im not interested in politics the problems of the world are not in my department im a saloon keeper
my friends in the underground tell me that you have quite a record you ran guns to ethiopia you fought against the fascists in spain	what of it
are you enough of a businessman to appreciate an offer of a hundred thousand francs	i appreciate it but i dont accept it
ill raise it to two hundred thousand	my friend you could make it a million francs or three my answer would still be the same
i beg your pardon	i said ask your wife
you know how you sound monsieur blaine like a man whos trying to convince himself of something he doesnt believe in his heart each of us has a destiny for good or for evil	yes i get the point
i wonder if you do i wonder if you know that youre trying to escape from yourself and that youll never succeed	you seem to know all about my destiny
i know a good deal more about you than you suspect i know for instance that you are in love with a woman it is perhaps strange that we both should be in love with the same woman the first evening i came here in this cafe i knew there was something between you and ilsa since no one is to blame i i demand no explanation i ask only one thing you wont give me the letters of transit all right but i want my wife to be safe i ask you as a favor to use the letters to take her away from casablanca	you love her that much
monsieur blaine i dont know how to thank you	oh save it weve still lots of things to do
i brought the money monsieur blaine	keep it youll need it in america
no its all arranged	good ive got the letters right here all made out in blank
everything in order	all except one thing theres something you should know before you leave
monsieur blaine i dont ask you to explain anything	im going to anyway because it may make a difference to you later on you said you knew about ilsa and me
yes	but you didnt know she was at my place last night when you were she came there for the letters of transit isnt that true ilsa
i understand	here it is
monsieur laszlo is it not	yes
i am captain renault prefect of police	yes what is it you want
merely to welcome you to casablanca and wish you a pleasant stay it is not often we have so distinguished a visitor	thank you i hope youll forgive me captain but the present french administration has not always been so cordial may i present miss ilsa lund
let us say that it is my request that is a much more pleasant word	very well
my bill	no two champagne cocktails please
well a precedent is being broken er emil	this is a very interesting cafe i congratulate you
ricky youre becoming quite human i suppose we have to thank you for that mademoiselle	ilsa i dont wish to be the one to say it but its late
i am delighted to see you both did you have a good nights rest	i slept very well
thats strange nobody is supposed to sleep well in casablanca	may we proceed with the business
i am afraid not my regrets monsieur	well perhaps i shall like it in casablanca
and the honor of having served the third reich	i was in a german concentration camp for a year thats honor enough for a lifetime
monsieur insofar as it is in my power 	 thank you
by the way monsieur last night you evinced an interest in signor ugarte	yes
i am making out the report now we havent quite decided whether he committed suicide or died trying to escape	are you quite finished with us
ive never accepted that privilege and im now on french soil	i should like to discuss some matters arising from your presence on french soil
this is hardly the time or the place	then we shall state another time and another place tomorrow at ten in the prefects office with mademoiselle
very well herr laszlo we will not mince words you are an escaped prisoner of the reich so far you have been fortunate enough in eluding us you have reached casablanca it is my duty to see that you stay in casablanca	whether or not you succeed is of course problematical
is that all you wish to tell us	dont be in such a hurry you have all the time in the world you may be in casablanca indefinitely or you may leave for lisbon tomorrow on one condition
and that is	you know the leaders of the underground movement in paris in prague in brussels in amsterdam in oslo in belgrade in athens
even in berlin	yes even in berlin if you will furnish me with their names and their exact whereabouts you will have your visa in the morning
and what if you track down these men and kill them what if you murdered all of us from every corner of europe hundreds thousands would rise to take our places even nazis cant kill that fast	herr laszlo you have a reputation for eloquence which i can now understand but in one respect you are mistaken you said the enemies of the reich could all be replaced but there is one exception no one could take your place in the event anything unfortunate should occur to you while you were trying to escape
for the time being	good day
you may find the climate of casablanca a trifle warm major	oh we germans must get used to all climates from russia to the sahara but perhaps you were not referring to the weather
what else my dear major	by the way the murder of the couriers what has been done
oh there is no hurry tonight hell be at ricks everybody comes to ricks	i have already heard about this cafe and also about mr rick himself
good evening gentlemen	good evening captain
thank you it is a pleasure to have you here major	champagne and a tin of caviar
may i recommend veuve cliquot 26 a good french wine	thank you
especially so tonight major in a few minutes you will see the arrest of the man who murdered your couriers	i expected no less captain
you repeat third reich as though you expected there to be others	well personally major i will take what comes
rick is completely neutral about everything and that takes in the field of women too	you werent always so carefully neutral we have a complete dossier on you
of course one must admit he has great courage	i admit he is very clever three times he slipped through our fingers in paris he continued his activities we intend not to let it happen again
mademoiselle	mademoiselle
i strongly suspect that ugarte left the letters of transit with mr blaine i would suggest you search the cafe immediately and thoroughly	if rick has the letters hes much too smart to let you find them there
you give him credit for too much cleverness my impression was that hes just another blundering american	but we mustnt underestimate american blundering i was with them when they blundered into berlin in 1918
as to laszlo we want him watched twentyfour hours a day	it may interest you to know that at this very moment he is on his way here
you see captain the situation is not as much under control as you believe	my dear major we are trying to cooperate with your government but we cannot regulate the feelings of our people
captain renault are you entirely certain which side youre on	i have no conviction if thats what you mean i blow with the wind and the prevailing wind happens to be from vichy
we are concerned about more than casablanca we know that every french province in africa is honeycombed with traitors waiting for their chance waiting perhaps for a leader	a leader like laszlo
uh huh i have been thinking it is too dangerous if we let him go it may be too dangerous if we let him stay	i see what you mean
you see what i mean if laszlos presence in a cafe can inspire this unfortunate demonstration what more will his presence in casablanca bring on i advise that this place be shut up at once	but everybodys having such a good time
yes much too good a time the place is to be closed	but i have no excuse to close it
why do you stand here why dont you stop him	ask monsieur rick
hello louis	how extravagant you are throwing away women like that someday they may be scarce
you know i think now i shall pay a call on yvonne maybe get her on the rebound eh	when it comes to women youre a true democrat
the plane to lisbon  you would like to be on it	why whats in lisbon
i was misinformed	huh
rick theres going to be some excitement here tonight we are going to make an arrest in your cafe	what again
if you are thinking of warning him dont put yourself out he cannot possibly escape	i stick my neck out for nobody
you know rick we could have made this arrest earlier in the evening at the blue parrot but out of my high regard for you we are staging it here it will amuse your customers	our entertainment is enough
i see and whats strasser doing here he certainly didnt come all the way to casablanca to witness a demonstration of your efficiency	perhaps not
how observant you are as a matter of fact i wanted to give you a word of advice	yeah have a brandy
thank you rick there are many exit visas sold in this cafe but we know that you have never sold one that is the reason we permit you to remain open	i thought it was because we let you win at roulette
that is another reason there is a man whos arrived in casablanca on his way to america he will offer a fortune to anyone who will furnish him with an exit visa	yeah whats his name
victor laszlo	victor laszlo
rick that is the first time i have ever seen you so impressed	well hes succeeded in impressing half the world
it is my duty to see that he doesnt impress the other half rick laszlo must never reach america he stays in casablanca	itll be interesting to see how he manages
manages what	his escape
oh but i just told you 	 stop it he escaped from a concentration camp and the nazis have been chasing him all over europe
is that a serious offer	i just paid out twenty id like to get it back
he is traveling with a lady	hell take one
i think not i have seen the lady and if he did not leave her in marseilles or in oran he certainly wont leave her in casablanca	maybe hes not quite as romantic as you are
it doesnt matter there is no exit visa for him	louis whatever gave you the impression that i might be interested in helping laszlo escape
oh laugh if you will but i happen to be familiar with your record let me point out just two items in 1935 you ran guns to ethiopia in 1936 you fought in spain on the loyalist side	and got well paid for it on both occasions
the winning side would have paid you much better	maybe well it seems you are determined to keep laszlo here
i have my orders	oh i see gestapo spank
yeah you were saying	excuse me
oh how do you do	and you already know herr heinze of the third reich
that makes rick a citizen of the world	i was born in new york city if thatll help you any
well you were asking about rick and here he is mademoiselle may i present 	 hello ilsa
oh its my party	another precedent gone this has been a very interesting evening ill call you a cab gasoline rationing time of night
well ricky im very pleased with you now youre beginning to live like a frenchman	that was some goingover your men gave my place this afternoon we just barely got cleaned up in time to open
how can you close me up on what grounds	i am shocked shocked to find that gambling is going on in here
but you havent any actual proof and you know it this isnt germany or occupied france all you can do is fine him a few thousand francs and give him thirty days you might as well let him go now	ricky id advise you not to be too interested in what happens to laszlo if by any chance you were to help him escape 
 what makes you think id stick my neck out for laszlo	because one youve bet ten thousand francs hed escape two you have the letters of transit now dont bother to deny it and well you might do it simply because you dont like strassers looks as a matter of fact i dont like him either
well theyre all excellent reasons	dont count too much on my friendship ricky in this matter im powerless besides i might lose ten thousand francs
youre not very subtle but you are effective i i get the point yes i have the letters but i intend using them myself im leaving casablanca on tonights plane the last plane	huh
and im taking a friend with me one youll appreciate	what friend
ilsa is laszlos wife she probably knows things that strasser would like to know louis ill make a deal with you instead of this petty charge you have against him you can get something really big something that would chuck him in a concentration camp for years that would be quite a feather in your cap wouldnt it	it certainly would germany vichy would be very grateful
ill arrange to have laszlo come there to pick up the letters of transit and thatll give you the criminal grounds on which to make the arrest you get him and we get away to the germans that last will be just a minor annoyance	theres still something about this business i dont quite understand miss lund shes very beautiful yes but you were never interested in any woman
i see how do i know youll keep your end of the bargain	ill make the arrangements right now with laszlo in the visitors pen
youre late	i was informed just as laszlo was about to leave the hotel so i knew id be on time
i thought i asked you to tie up your watchdogs	oh he wont be followed here
you know this place will never be the same without you ricky	yes i know what you mean but ive already spoken to ferrari youll still win at roulette
i have the letters right here	tell me when we searched the place where were they
sams piano	serves me right for not being musical
 not so fast louis nobodys going to be arrested not for a while yet	have you taken leave of your senses
i have sit down over there	put that gun down
call off your watchdogs you said	just the same you call the airport and let me hear you tell them and remember this guns pointed right at your heart
if you dont mind you fill in the names that will make it even more official	you think of everything dont you
well i was right you are a sentimentalist	stay where you are i dont know what youre talking about
what you just did for laszlo and that fairy tale that you invented to send ilsa away with him i know a little about women my friend she went but she knew you were lying	anyway thanks for helping me out
well rick youre not only a sentimentalist but youve become a patriot	maybe but it seemed like a good time to start
it might be a good idea for you to disappear from casablanca for a while theres a free french garrison over at brazzaville i could be induced to arrange a passage	my letter of transit i could use a trip but it doesnt make any difference about our bet you still owe me ten thousand francs
and that ten thousand francs should pay our expenses	our expenses
uh huh	louis i think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship
where were you last night	thats so long ago i dont remember
will i see you tonight	i never make plans that far ahead
give me another	sacha shes had enough
rick im sick and tired of having you 	 sacha call a cab
come on were going to get your coat	take your hands off me
make it official if you like	what is your nationality
i understand you came here from paris at the time of the occupation	there seems to be no secret about that
are you one of those people who cannot imagine the germans in their beloved paris	its not particularly my beloved paris
well there are certain sections of new york major that i wouldnt advise you to try to invade	aha who do you think will win the war
not particularly i understand the point of view of the hound too	victor laszlo published the foulest lies in the prague newspapers until the very day we marched in and even after that he continued to print scandal sheets in a cellar
youll excuse me gentlemen your business is politics mine is running a saloon	good evening mr blaine
i would advise you not to interfere	i was willing to shoot captain renault and im willing to shoot you
hello	put that phone down
uh excuse me please hello rick	hello ugarte
huh you know rick watching you just now with the deutsches bank one would think youd been doing this all your life	well what makes you think i havent
oh nothing but when you first came to casablanca i thought 	 you thought what
may i too bad about those two german couriers wasnt it	they got a lucky break yesterday they were just two german clerks today theyre the honored dead
thank you  will you have a drink with me please	no
i forgot you never drink with  ill have another please  you despise me dont you	if i gave you any thought i probably would
but why oh you object to the kind of business i do huh but think of all those poor refugees who must rot in this place if i didnt help them thats not so bad through ways of my own i provide them with exit visas	for a price ugarte for a price
but think of all the poor devils who cannot meet renaults price i get it for them for half is that so parasitic	i dont mind a parasite i object to a cutrate one
well rick after tonight ill be through with the whole business and i am leaving finally this casablanca	who did you bribe for your visa renault or yourself
one moment tonight ill be selling those for more money than even i have ever dreamed of and then addio casablanca you know rick i have many friends in casablanca but somehow just because you despise me youre the only one i trust will you keep these for me please	for how long
perhaps an hour perhaps a little longer	i dont want them here overnight
rick rick help me	dont be a fool you cant get away
sam ferrari wants you to work for him at the blue parrot	i like it fine here
hell double what i pay you	yeah but i aint got time to spend the money i make here

but you had so much responsibility	i never asked for any responsibility
privacy is exactly the point of drive in movies	did you come here with wallyto not watch movies

what will be okay	we have to wait and see i think that for everything in life you have to wait and see
olive told me  you might have told me yourself	im just waiting and seeing like you said
do you think im having a good time do you think im just teasing you do you think i know whether i want you or wally	so we should wait and see for how long
i grew up with wally i began my adult life with him	fine thats all there is to it then
no thats not all there is to it i love you tooi know i do	okay okayi know you do too
we should take her to st clouds that much is obvious isnt it let her make up her mind when she gets there	i told her she doesnt feel she can do that something about her father not letting her go anywhere
she wont go to st clouds	well we cant force her its her decision
you dont understand its her father	mr rose knows
wait wait are you sure	weve got to keep her away from that bastard

isnt that like waiting and seeing	no nothing is nothing i want wally to come home im afraid to see him too

homer wells born portland maine march 2 1915	homer was born here in what was it 1922
you mean theyll replace you with someone who wont perform abortions	well we can only guess about that edna they are against the law
so here is my candidate what do you think	but what about school records homer doesnt have any diplomas
or that he cant be bothered to write us a proper letter a dissertation on apples we dont need	he probably doesnt make much money picking appleshe must have had to pay to send them too
i just wanted to ask you	edna come dance with me lets be foolish tonight
is your father dead	cirrhosisits a disease of the liver
liver killed him	alcohol killed himhe drank himself to death
but did you know him	barely it hardly mattered that i knew him
did you know your mother better	shes dead now too she was a nanny
did you grow up around here	no she was an immigrant
homer doesnt king kong think the woman is his mother	uh surethats what kong thinks all right
i was a posthumous child my fathers eyes had closed upon the light of this world six months when mine opened on it	his fathers dead right
uh its the end of october	is that soon
did you bite it	i dont remember
it looks like you bit ititll be all right	maybe i was kissing someone and he bit me
no you did it yourself maybe in your sleep	i must have been dreaming of kissing someone
im sorry theyre not used to seeing a car like this	its okayi dont mind
so now uh youre not i mean do you do the	no dr larch will be performing the procedure
what kind of plane are you flying	a b24 liberator
liberator	have you enlisted
they wouldnt take me im class iv ive got a heart defect	really is it serious
has anyone offered you anything to eat	actually someone did i just didnt think i could eat anything
where are you going	were heading back to cape kenneth
i think id probably like the apple business	youre a little overqualified arent you
no im not i need a job	the only jobs are picking jobs picking apples is truly boring
this is all normal dont worry the abortion procedure it affects you its the ether too itll take a little time	i dont have any time theres a war
at what altitude	ive got thirtyfive minutes to climb to fifteen thousand feetthats the first mountain pass
uh look if youre serious about wanting a job picking apples isnt that boring	oh i would love that wally
its almost like flying	what about the trees
uh im shipping out sooner than i thought i just wanted to be sure you were settled inand happy enough considering  are you bored stiff or can you stick it out for a bit	uh actually picking apples is as much excitement as i want for a while im grateful for the job
youre the one whos helping me homer youre going to give my mom a little peace of mind while im gone candy too	well sure thats good then  all i mean is im lucky i met you
so what should i do now	out back theres a shed its just a mess if that shed was better organized i could put my truck in there
its big enough to keep you out of the war i suppose aint that right	right
thats better i can tell you got yourself some education thems good hands you got homer them hands you got they know what theyre doin aint that right	i guess so
are we supposed to be up here the rules said	homer you the only one whos read them rules so you the only one who feels like hes doin somethin wrong

let me hear you say that i so unhappy she runned away that i killed myself that what happen here aint that right	right
i presume youd prefer handling the delivery	all i said was i dont want to perform abortions i have no argument with you performing them
you know how to help these women how can you not feel obligated to help them when they cant get help anywhere else	one its illegal two i didnt ask how to do ityou just showed me
there was no visible wound	no the fetus was dead her uterus was virtually disintegratingmy stitches pulled right through the tissue
it looks like scurvy	scurvy ah yes the curse of the old time sailor suffering long periods at sea with no fresh fruits or vegetables homer dorothy isnt a sailor
its obviously an aborticide	obviously
christ its oil of tansy	i dont know it
if you take enough of it your intestines lose their ability to absorb vitamin c	in other words scurvy
fuzzy is not uncommon i tell you theres something about the premature babies of alcoholic mothers they seem susceptible to every damn thing that comes along	i havent read that
i havent either but you will the morons who write the books should do a little research here	but isnt fuzzy just well underdeveloped
he doesnt like it  hes a boy thats why	cant a boy be a dorrit
i dont think so	you do it then
henceforth you shall be little wilbur	im not crazy about the little
okay hes just a wilbur then	we havent had a wilbur here in a year or so have we we used to have dozens
i thought you took care of this it always breaks in the same place its your splice isnt it	its your splice you blame me for everything
how about expecting people to be responsible enough to control themselves to begin with	how about this child you expect her to be responsible
its just a marvel to me that you still have such high expectations of people	im happy i amuse you
try to look at it this way what choice does buster have what are his options nobody will ever adopt him 	try to look at it this way buster and i are sitting right here beside you we could have ended up in the incinerator 
doubtless youll let me know what immensely worthwhile or at least useful thing it is that you find to do	i wasnt intending to leave here in order to be entirely uselessi expect ill find some ways to be of use
in other parts of the world i suppose there are other ways	of course
are you really so stupid that you imagine youre going to find a more gratifying life what youre going to find is people like the poor people who get left hereonly nobody takes care of them as well and you wont be able to take care of them either theres no taking care of anybody not out there	you know im grateful for everything youve done for me
i dont need thisi know all about my condition	its your heartyou ought to take it with you

you cant think that a man who has served under such conditions as exist over there will be in the slightest daunted by a little snow have you no idea how harsh and primitive and full of disease that part of the world is	then i suppose we can look forward to catching various diseases from him
when the plane was hit the crew chief and the radioman jumped close together the copilot jumped third all on captain worthingtons orders the captain was still flying the plane none of the men of the ground could see the skythats how thick the jungle was they never saw the plane crashthey never heard it crash they never saw captain worthingtons parachute either	why was he missing for twenty days

rose rose has runned away	she took off in the night
you ever see a palm tree homer	he aint never been outta maine
brutal day they say the streets are lined with money down here but i guess you have to know the secret handshake what are you drinking	uh makers mark rocks
my names grant grant ashby	oh god im overbearing and rude lily lily finn
silicon valley	thats right so brainiacs that we are we thought wed be innovative and relocate east try our luck with a straight corporate loan out here
so weve been meeting with banks all day its amazing how many ways they can say no without ever using the word	well typically corporate loans are relatively simple matters but you do need to demonstrate a capacity for gross fund recovery
oh well thanks for the drink	youre welcome i was just going to ask you if youd like to join us
what do you do over at your bank grant	what do i do im the vp of finance
heres where a little research comes in handy corporate banks give out vp titles like calendars its a small lie but now were sure hes playing	maybe you can help us understand whats so hard about getting a corporate loan
well typically speaking theyre not as long as you can demonstrate 	a capacity for gross fund recovery yeah we got that part
banks need to know how theyre going to get their money back	we know exactly how were going to make the money back there in lies the catch22
listen what im about to tell you im telling you in confidence okay  have you ever heard of a company called bigcom	bigcom that internet thing
right the guys who started that did what a lot of companies in the valley do they get a good idea shop it around raise some capital then sell it off to a bigger company microsoft intel oracle whatever the beauty of it is theyve pretty much sold the company before theyre even real the bigger company is already set to buy it all they want to do is make sure that the idea actually works so they get some start up capital make it work then sell it for like five times the initial loan	sort of like a letter of intent
exactly but the catch22 is that you cant tell anyone about the offer because if its public you could start a bidding war and thats considered a breach of etiquette it could kill a deal but wait too long and youre not considered hot anymore	and you have this letter of intent
we had to finalize the deal	everything looks in order
this has to happen fast	i know it wont go unnoticed
whats this	you need some convincing consider it a convincer
lets just slow down for a second	youre worried about recouping the loan i already told you
then there it is ashby gets the itch	the standard ten
ten percent of how much	two million
same thing with playing a con you have to be able to see that deep	jake right uhhuh uhhuh yeah its going through 
hey jake when am i gonna get to play the inside	gordo plays the inside youre the shill
yeah but come on all i get to do is cry and get insulted	what are you talking about you should get a fucking academy award for the shill work you do  we got it down cold al you dont want to jinx it by changing something up do you
and i think its because of this redhead	know who i am jake
the antichrist	no im not the antichrist or the prince of darkness im just a guy looking for some answers
things are probably going to end badly for you jake	gee what makes you say that
grifters	we cant all be model citizens such as yourself
its all about the money isnt it	isnt it always
keeping the fix happy	you never know when you can use a crooked cop
keep going i want to know how you got lionel dolby	so you want to know how to play the big con
so howd you get caught	suits used to say that in any con sooner or later someones going to start asking the right questions usually it takes a little longer
i can see why you liked her	that was it we had our crew now we needed the mark
but there were other factors	factors that werent clear to me until now
hes just as crooked as the next guy youd think hed have more important things to do with tax payer dollars	cue the fucking violins come on its getting cold
nice	we got our stake now we need to find our guy in gilletts bank
thanks did you know you shouldnt light three cigarettes with a match	back in wwi or wwii one of the wws if you took the time to light three cigarettes with one match some nazi would be able to figure out where you were then well it was the last cigarette you and your two buddies ever had so three on a match is bad luck
youre a superstitious fucker	lucks a funny thing especially the bad
like what	having a gun pointed at you for one its not like breaking a mirror bad luck but its bad three on a match black cats believe it believe it all
is that what it was jake was it love	you know when the first con was ever played it was when adam fell for eve in the garden of eden
so much for honor among thieves you would have cut loose your friends your girl	i was doing it for them
bullshit you were scared jake you lost your nerve you lost your confidence you werent being noble you werent trying to save anybody but yourself admit it	its not true
we were back on	after you cut her loose
alrlght alrlght what happened today	today started off great
alright turn around she doesnt get shit unless i get that money where is it	probably safe in the hands of the federal government
oh jake you disappoint me and you just let lily here down again what was it you said about playing the big con	its like putting on a play where everyone knows their part except for the mark
like putting on a play guess some people forgot their lines	guess so
not that i recall what do you want us to do about it	lets see lets suppose he gets to customs and he gets caught we get our money back but then we have to deal with a criminal investigation i dont much like that idea then again lets suppose he actually gets through customs now thatll be something we recover the money in cash and let the insurance cover the corporate fraud we double our money

hey i been on the ramp all my life so i got no problem with the way you help yourself jake	i saw you go up from the knecker working that grind learning the barnards law and i thought the kids a prodigy but i know that if youre using these goods so then i figure whats worth that youre either looking for a little history or a retirement fund whos the mark

i dont doubt your talent you looking for that place in the hall of fame	its not history
so what do you want	i want to get out from under all this for good and i want to fuck them all doing it

special agent	you are officer richard rottovich and this would be officer walter sobozinski im looking for jake vig
preliminary forensics suggests he was sitting there bloated and purple in his egg foo young for at least seventy two hours alfonse was not a small man and there was a lot of food ordered so you can imagine the smell bad for the neighbors good for me because in all the time ive been looking for jake this is only the second time ive even gotten a whiff of him	look special agent moonan we dont know what youre talking about
if you feds are so hot for him why dont we just bring him in right now	i want him for something big and to do that we have to catch him in the act
like we told you before we think hes into something with the king pin 	look im not a confrontational person by nature
did he buy it	i think so whatd he ever do to you anyway
do you want to know the first time i had a line on vig he sent me a birthday card  belated but its the thought right oh this pricks got a sense of humor but then again you guys probably know him better than i do in fact ive only met the guy once but now now i have you the next best thing his partners his fix	what do you want
you help me catch him whatever hes into next i want you to be into and what youre into im into if it all goes well those two guys from iad will never have to hear this tape ill clear you guys of anything youve ever done with vig under the guise of some cross departmental investigation this pricks been on the wish list for so long youll probably get gold shields out of it	what do you get out of it
this guy must have been a real pain in your dick	literally its not a bad deal gentleman i get peace of mind you get detective sheilds but this is the best part walter walter your daughter will get to keep her braces and have that winning smile capice

this is our crows nest im showing it to you now but youll never see it again	very impressive
you can start monday week	fine
i just want the job	jack youre not the usual type we get here
why dont you take a break jack	all right mr reynolds
mr tchai always likes to play at that table and only with bella	does he win
thanks for the information	a pleasure pity about bella
how do you feel jack	bruised
i have a reduced drive reading of seven thousand	right that checks out here
ninety seven million minus eight corrected to mass critical	i read that with a quantum increase of seven
im getting this flickering light on one of my panels	what flickering light
the one on unit oh i think its gmr twelve zero zero	oh whats wrong now
im not sure i think something is fucked up somewhere in the ship though	i hope its not the oven again
yeah	remember when the artificial gravity went out in the toilet
there she is definite 99plus probability that the planet is going to deviate from its normal orbit in another twelve thousand rotations itll spiral in toward its sun and 	eventual supernova
i can tell the damn thing just doesnt understand	look bomb
no no the key the key to the fail safe lock	key
wheres the failsafe key	the key
where is it what did you do with it	i dont have it i dont know where it is
the key goddamit the key	christ twenty seconds christ
where is the key	were gonna die boiler were gonna die
it didnt go off	oh god
it didnt go off	boiler were alive my heart
what was that i didnt hear	its talby hes drifting away from the ship without his jetpack
what the hell	yoo hoo bomb
well now what what do you have for us now boiler	not much nothing at all in this sector
find me something i dont care where it is	well i show a 95 probability of sentient life in the horsehead nebula
fuck that shit	well it is kind of a long shot
remember what we found fourteen light years for a fucking mindless vegetable that looked like a limp balloon and went squawk and let a fart when you touched it remember	all right then
hey doolittle heres one an unstable planet 85 probability of an unstable planet in the veil nebula that will probably go off its orbit and hit a star	sounds good chart a course for the veil nebula
why doesnt talby ever eat down here with the rest of us	he just likes it up in the dome thats all
quantum is up thirtyfive	i read the same here
talby talby can you read me	can you beat that i always knew talby was weird
well bomb we have about sixty seconds to drop just wondering if everything is all right have you checked your platinum euridium energy shielding	energy shielding positive function
swell lets synchronize detonation time do you know when youre supposed to go off	detonation in six minutes twenty seconds
all right i have detonation time at wait a minute somethings wrong with the clock  all right i have detonation time at no that cant be right it says three years  okay i have six minutes exactly does that check out down there	check at six minutes
armed	well then everything sounds fine well drop you off in thirtyfive seconds good luck
thanks	begin main sequence mark at 1098 7654321drop
fail safe in lock four minutes to drop 22 minutes to detonation this is sergeant pinback calling bomb 20 do you read me bomb	bomb 20 to sergeant pinback roger i read you continue
one hundred twenty seconds to drop bomb have you checked your platinum euridium energy shielding	energy shielding positive function
do you remember the detonation time	detonation in twenty minutes
but you cant explode in the bomb bay its foolish youll kill us all theres no reason for it	i am programmed to detonate in nine minutes detonation will occur at the programmed time
you are false data	huh
therefore i shall ignore you	hello bomb
false data can act only as a distraction therefore i shall refuse to perceive you	hey bomb
the only thing which exists is myself	bomb
snap out of it bomb	in the beginning there was darkness and the darkness was without form and void
hey bomb	and i saw that i was alone
this is lieutenant doolittle calling bomb 20 i repeat previous order you are to disarm yourself and return immediately to the bomb bay do you understand	i am programmed to detonate in fourteen minutes thirty seconds detonation will occur at the programmed time
bomb this is doolittle you are not to detonate repeat you are not to detonate in the bomb bay disarm yourself this is an order	i read you lieutenant doolittle but i am programmed to detonate in fourteen minutes detonation will occur at the programmed time
are you willing to entertain a few concepts	i am always receptive to suggestions
well of course i exist	but how do you know you exist
hmm well i think therefore i am	thats good very good now then how do you know that anything else exists
my sensory apparatus reveals it to me	right
this is fun	all right now heres the big question how do you know that the evidence your sensory apparatus reveals to you is correct
what im getting at is this the only experience that is directly available to you is your sensory data and this data is merely a stream of  electrical impulses which stimulate your computing center	in other words all i really know about the outside universe relayed to me through my electrical connections
exactly	why that would mean i really dont know what the outside universe is like at all for certain
thats it	intriguing i wish i had more time to discuss this matter
why dont you have more time	because i must detonate in seventy five seconds
now bomb consider this next question very carefully what is your one purpose in life	to explode of course
and you can only do it once right	that is correct
and you wouldnt want to explode on the basis of false data would you	of course not
well then youve already admitted that you have no real proof of the existence of the outside universe	yes well
so you have no absolute proof that sergeant pinback ordered you to detonate	i recall distinctly the detonation order my memory is good on matters like these
yes of course you remember it but what you are remembering is merely a series of electrical impulses which you now realize have no necessary connection with outside reality	true but since this is so i have no proof that you are really telling me all this
you may be doing so on the basis of false data	i have no proof that it was false data
ah what was that again i still cant hear you	i said im trying to reach talby somethings wrong with the damn intercom i need a lastminute diameter approximation
i need a ghf reading on the gravity correction	ill check it
pinback	yes doolittle
yes	i need a computer reading on a fail safe mark
in a second	boiler can you set me up with some temp figures
new star  hey guess what i got a new star on the readout	which one
yeah eight it says here	any of em any good
what are you gonna name it	what
the new star what are you gonna name it	who cares dont bother me
commander powell would have named it	commander powell is dead
come on doolittle give it a name	fred
wha	i hereby name this star fred
hey doolittle think well ever find real intelligent life out there	out where
veil nebula	who cares
 automatic channels open 	 remark
im coming in now im down by the emergency air lock too much trouble to come in the ventral lock would you blow the seal on the emergency hatch so i can come in	oh sure
talby	oh ah yes doolittle what is it
you know talby you really ought to eat with the rest of us you spend too much time up here	i like it up here
must get lonely being up here so much	i dont like to go below since commander powell died i feel enclosed down there if it were big enough id sleep up here
should spend some time below see more of the rest of the ship	you see i can watch things up here doolittle i love to watch things just stare at the planets and meteors and asteroids gas clusters
youll have plenty of time for that you know figure it this way twenty years in space and weve only aged three so therell be plenty of time to stare around	you know doollttle if were going into the veil nebula we may actually find a strange and beautiful thing the phoenix asteroids they should be passing through there about now
phoenix asteroids never heard of em	they are a body of asteroids that make a complete circuit of the universe once every 123 trillion years the phoenix asteroids from what ive heard doolittle they glow glow with all the colors of the rainbow nobody knows why they just glow as they drift around the universe imagine all the sights theyve seen in the time theyve been travelling  the birth and death of stars things well never see the universe is alive doolittle i thought it was all empty but it isnt in between the stars its seething with light and gasses and dust there are little pebbles drifting around planets no one on earth has ever seen no one but the phoenix asteroids
you know what i think about talby	im getting something here on this readout
its funny but i kind of sit around you know a lot of time to myself	i think im getting a malfunction here somewhere
i cant talk to the others but with time to myself i think about back home back home at malibu i used to surf a lot talby i used to be a great surfer	lieutenant doolittle im getting a definite malfunction on one of the closedcircuit computer systems
the waves at malibu and zuma were fantastic in the springs talby i can remember running out on the beach early spring mornings with my board and a wet suit	i cant seem to locate the malfunction exactly
waves would be peaking really high and glassy hit that water ridin the wall just perfect	somewhere in the autonomic relay circuits
ah doolittle i do have a malfunction on this readout but i cant seem to pinpoint exactly where it is	dont worry about it well find out when it goes bad
i really think i should try and locate it immediately might be something important	i wish i had my board with me now even if i could only polish it once in awhile
lieutenant doolittle this is talby lieutenant	yes talby what is it
ah well i think ive found the malfunction sir im in the emergency air lock	not now
doolittle help me	calm down talby im coming
doolittle doolittle where are you	here i am i think im spinning were both falling talby in opposite directions away from each other my  my jetpacks gone
it is doolittle its the phoenix they glow with all the colors of the rainbow just like everybody said	no kidding
im going into them im going to hit them doolittle	yeah
before we get too far away and our signals start to fade i just wanted to tell you you were my favorite i really liked you doolittle	i really liked you too talby hey some debris from the ship its coming right by me
commander powell this is doolittle ah theres something serious come up sir and i have to ask you something	im glad youve come to talk with me doolittle its been so long since anyone has come to talk with me
commander sir we have a big problem you see the veil nebula bomb bomb number 20 is stuck it wont drop from the bomb bay it refuses to listen and plans to detonate in    less than eleven minutes	doolittle you must tell me one thing
whats that sir	tell me doolittle how are the dodgers doing
you dont understand sir we cant get the bomb to drop	ah so many malfunctions why dont you have anything nice to tell me when you activate me oh well did you try the azimuth clutch
yes sir negative effect	what was that doolittle
negative effect	it didnt work
commander powell commander hello	doolittle hello
sorry sir you faded out there for a minute	sorry
commander are you still there	oh yes doolittle im thinking
were running out of time sir	oh yes well doolittle if you cant get it to drop youll have to talk to it
sir	talk to the bomb
i already have sir and pinback is talking to it now	no no doolittle you talk to it teach it phenomenology doolittle
men men what happened men	yeah the skipper always was lucky
oh yeah	yeah
but see tonight wives and girlfriends arent invited	no
mr sonrisa saw you on the cameras  he wants you to come see him	im on a break
no wire	now that thats out of the way you want the woman heres how it works  you pull fifty large out of your mattress or wherever and i make a call to bring her in
or we can work on your face with a pair of pliers for a couple of hours and you tell us where she is	or we could go another way cause your boss seems to like my face just the way it is
look that thing about the pliers i was just doing what the man pays me to do ya know  comin off hard	yeah sure i understand
i never woulda done it  probably not anyway  i mean i actually think youre pretty cool	yeah
man you got a bad attitude	i like to keep it professional thats all
call the skank now or i start redecorating	you havent figured this out yet have you  you walk in here thinking youre gonna cap her then cap me and take the money back to your boss with your tail wagging but see its really the other way around  you think im the whack when actually youre the whack

trying to have a relationship with you max is like standing in a fog bank  you know youre in the middle of something only you have absolutely no idea where you are	and when the fog lifted theres darren with his head under justines skirt
why would i be pissed	it was a complicated situation which could have been misconstrued causing you to maybe take offense
i was crazy about youam crazy about you  but you keep everyone at arms length like theres some great big dark something going on that i dont know its just that the more i tried to get close to you the more you pulled away	im really glad were having this conversation  youre right  i was angry at you  but talking about it the scales have fallen from my eyes and i see now that it was all my fault  can you ever forgive me

what makes you cry	if im sad or tired or sometimes when im angry or when somebodys being mean to me

original cindy say hi to my good friend	logan cale
sorry about your window	can we go somewhere and talk
howd you find me	wasnt that hard
am i sposed to be flattered by all the attention	now you know who i am where i live  i figured i better find out who im dealing with in case you were looking to hurt me
girlfriend	one of my sources  her husband was murdered by edgar sonrisa
whats your shot in all this  being a famous anonymous underground pirate cyberjournalist cant be much of a payday	fortunately my needs are met in that department
so what you just like the sound of your own voice	look around at all this  built by people who got up every morning and worked hard trying to make a better life  then the bomb happened and everyone got scared  they blinked and before they knew it theyd given away the store to a bunch of thugs who were happy to take it off their hands  overnight the government the police everything intended to protect the people had been turned against them
so what are you gonna do about it	something
personally im more interested in going fast on my motorcycle or climbing the trans american building with my pals instead of giving myself a headache over stuff i cant do anything about	you accept the way things are youre an active participant in making it worse
is the social studies class over for today	yeah
ever notice how cats always seem to turn up around dinner time	i wont be staying
like following me around and pestering the people i work with wasnt bad enough but breaking into my apartment	it was open
you got a lotta nerve	me  youre the one who tried to rip off this piece
am i sposed to be grateful	that would be appropriate yes
howm i sposed to ever sleep there again knowing some pervos probably touched everything i own	youre that nervous youre welcome to stay here
whoa there tex  weve been through all this	its alright peter were fine
look if i made you nervous or uncomfortable or creeped you out	yes on all counts
im sorry  it wasnt my intention  but i had to see you	youd think a guy whos taken on the job of saving the world would have a few more important things to do than traipse around after some girl
i havent been able to get you off my mind	you need to get out more
gold leaf art nouveau french early nineteen hundreds i could probably fence this for three or four grand	no i meant this
expensive gifts surprise latenight visits overthetop flattery you always come on this strong	only when i meet someone i have to know everything about

the other one like you	you lost me
ltriptophanea neurotransmitter sometimes used in homeopathy to control seizures  then the lightbulb went off	you did go through my stuff
i dont know what kind of game youre playing here but im out because you are a whackjob	he was working on something called project manticore which was using recombinant dna to produce a superior humana warrioran advanced infantry soldier
not that i dont enjoy a good urban legend now and then but what does any of this have to do with me	the bar code on your neck max  i know who you are and i know who youre running from
we got separated right away  i never knew how many made it	how well do you remember the lab
i remember fine  i just didnt understand what was going on  they never told us anything except what to do  it took me a long time afterwards to figure things out	how much do you know
i know they made me  even got the label on my neck to prove it	the technical term for you is chimera
yeaha madeup creature  like in mythologywith the head of a lion the body of a goat and the tail of	a girl
your basic hodgepodge	hardly
christmas is a snap when you got no parents or relatives just a bunch of gene sequences from probably twenty different people	like extra virgin olive oil the best of the best
you said you could help	i need to find this technician or anyone else who knows about project manticore they wouldve used surrogate mothers to carry you after the invitro work if i can track down one of them
whats in it for you	your help
i already dont like the sound of this	the woman you met lauren  she supervised workers removing cortodiazapine from gel caps by hand and replacing it with powdered sugar  the real drug was shipped out of the country the placebos were distributed to county va hospital and six veterans clinics in the area
thats low but this effects me how exactly	shes prepared to testify that she was instructed to do this by one of edgar sonrisas managers  you know who sonrisa is
i didnt make it this far by attracting a lot of attention	shes put her life on the line and her faith in me
theyve lost track of me and i plan to keep it that way	youre a soldier max  thats what you were put here for  but soldiers need a mission otherwise they tear themselves up
see youre back and still rocking the boat	somebodys got to
im sorry	my mother used to say the universe is right on schedule  everything happens like its supposed to
you believe that	ive never been much for trying to understand why bad things happen i just know they do  so the jobs to figure out how to deal with the consequences  which you did you took that sonuvabitch out
well not me personally	on accounta you sonrisa didnt get to buy off the jury or kill the judge hes gone  once and for all  it was war max and you won
whats this	open it
it turned up on the black market  one of my sources thought i might be interested	i dont know what to say
fortyseven people drowned last night off the coast of vancouver after paying smugglers twenty thousand apiece to get into canada so they could get work in order to eat  only they got marched overboard at gunpoint instead	look thank you for this but
these girls kidnapped during the last month and sold overseas to the highest bidder  the oldest is twelve  the youngest about the same age you were when you escaped	and i feel real bad about all that but it doesnt mean i need to get involved
you are involved  by being alive youre involved	were quoting mom again
maybe we got screwed outta living in a time when we could sit in a cafe sipping our lattes wearing two thousand dollar wrist watches while we plan our next vacation  but the world got a whole lot meaner all of a sudden  wasnt sposed to but it did  and its back to the law of the jungle  you got your predators and you got your victims	and you still think you can do something to change that
that was taken nine years ago idd as michael hanover  sentenced to 18 months in the state penn at rawlins wyoming for armed robbery  he escaped from custody after 4 days  hasnt been seen or heard from since	zack he made it hes alive
im looking for a lady who works here	ladies would be elsewhere

i need to talk to her	cant help you
max something  i got no clue where she stays	any idea when shell be back
none	ill wait
who is it	a friend of your fiances
what do you want	to set the record straight about where he was the other night when he said he was working late
who are you	my names lydia  and it seems you and i have a lot in common
you said you knew where my fiance was the other night	with me where hes been after work three sometimes four nights a week for the last two months we have what you might call an intimate relationship
look i dont know what you want	i thought it was important for you to know the facts
and so should you  sketchy told me i could expect a visit from you  i know all about how you threatened him  that if he didnt break it off with me youd save him the trouble	oh
well its over between you and him were getting married next month	how sweet  standing by your man even after what he did  youre a very understanding person
big part of loving someones being able to forgive them	youre also a fool
i think you should go now	not before we get something straight you prissy little bitch  i decide when im done with your boyfriend  not him and certainly not you  unless maybe you want to find out just how sharp these nails really are
this is not a place you wanna go	let go of my hand
help lemme go no dont let me go help	now heres how its gonna be lydia youre gonna take your threats and your acrylic nails and youre gonna go home and figure out your marriage instead of trying to make other people feel as miserable as you do understand
say the words i understand	i understand
you drive away business roarin in like that	yeah does kinda break the elegant atmosphere you got goin on here
you got a punkass mouth on you kid	my names not kid  its client  as in the person who pays for your opulent lifestyle  now you got something for me or not
i got a hit on the car  an ohfive tahoe blue with wyoming tags agt349 it wasnt easy cause you were off in one of the numbers	sorry i was seven at the time
whos this guy  this isnt who were looking forher name was hannah	he got the car in a trade for his old pickup and some foodno bill of sale or nothing  it was right after the pulse so all the dmv records were wiped  so we dont get anything on the seller  except i actually managed to find this guy six hours on the phone say thank you
thank you	he says he got it from a woman  doesnt remember her name but she fits the description you gave like a glove
she was a nurse  she mustve lived near there somewhere near the  the clinic  there must be some registry of nurses or medical technicians or whatever for wyoming	only a last name would be nice  or the nearest town to thisclinic
you were gonna run through the law enforcement databases for a match on identifying marks	nothing so far from arrests hospital admissions or coroners  this kind of searchits heavy spadework  im gonna need
as long as youre okay	ill live regarding your caseim afraid ive come up with some bad news on your fiance  lemme get the file
i dont know what your story is and i dont want to	heres your money
whoever tossed this place wants you  and im looking to stay outta the line of fire	hows this about me
they lifted my wallet to make it look like a robbery  but theres a bug in my computer keyboard a tap on the phone and a mike in the light fixture	like you said maybe somebodys tracking one of your investigations
hardwares too sophisticated  its gotta be the government  and why do i think theyre looking for you	youre crazy
your fiance has four previous wives  his mo is to clean em out and take off  which is what you oughta do	bastard
zero cmon dan i dont have all day	got a pencil
just give it to me  ill remember	onesevenfourninefive natoma
at least he didnt swing with your ride	no but i broke a nail giving him a cranium crack and that just sort of wrecks your day know what im saying
now why cant i find a girlfriend like that  brings him lunch everyday thoughtful sweet legs from here to there	straight
craps all over everything and everyone and then wants mommy to forgive him	what guys do  nother order
thats odd	what
tell me the truth  am i a female fog bank	youre not seriously buying into darrens nonsense
no	he was just trying to blame you cause hes a slut
if i knew what you were saying i wouldnt be asking	how long you and me known each other
a long time	long enough for you to pretty much read me like a book right
because youre probably my closest friend in the whole world	and back at ya  only theres a part of you thats i dont know
a fog bank	more like a mystery which isnt bad its just kinduvmysterious
gotta go	where
youre actually gonna bail sketchy out	yeah cause maybe hes learned his lesson
friends dont help other friends cheat	and because i actually kinda feel sorry for guys sometimes
please	theyre prisoners to their genes
so are dogs	they dont have a lot of moving parts
i say hang the bastard out to dry let her see him for the heel he is then maybe shell step to the allgirl team and let mamalicious ease her pain	but of course theres nothing self serving in that scenario
yeah i can see to it your winning streak continues	ill bet you can  sit
not right now	not right now  okay when
only way youre ever gonna find out is reincarnation fact is you are gonna pay me and i am gonna provide you with a service	i actually know how this works
who are you	what you gonna put me on your christmas card list
look youre a player im bringing you this on a plate and my fee is just the normal cost of doing business	pull the cash
so how do you get the woman to come to me	i told her its just business to you that all you want is a reasonable solution to this  you give her daughter back she agrees to leave the country  i play the guarantor drive her down to mexico tonight and put her on a train to brazil or wherever
and she bought that	i have sincere eyes
make the call	shes gonna need to know that her little girls alright
shes got my word	shes gonna want to hear for herself
playing hooky again	feel like the dogs dinner
probably a touch of whats going around	i know what i got max  they put me back on that drug theyre giving the other vets  only the guy does those cable hacks says the stuffs no good
dont believe everything you hear on tv	what if hes on the level
heres the dealio on eyes only  hes probably some wack rich dude sitting around in a trickass apartment bored stupid  so he gets off on scarin the poop outta folks like you i gotta go	tell everybody hey
quitting time  grab a cold one	i gotta meet natalie for dinner
right the big oneoh	but ill take a rain check
hey sketchy	we gotta talk
i dont see how you cheating on natalie involves me	i know what youre thinking  but the truth is this other person is not someone im in love with  as a matter of fact after what she just did shes not even someone i like much  so in a technical sense im not sure you could call me and her cheatingofficially
or do you think were just so grateful to have one of you idiots well look the other way which is arrogant and condescending	lame selfserving arrogantguilty as charged
you left out condescending	but theres another side
here it comes  the part where the guy turns everything around	im the victim here
really	hear me out  this person ive been seeing is a jam pony client who happens to be married
and you were a sympathetic ear	exactly
then a sympathetic mouth then a sympathetic	she had me followed the other day and found out about natalie  now this persons demanding i blow her off or shell do it for me by telling nat about us
does this person have a name	lydia
and lydia telling natalie the truth makes you a victim in what way	im a toy to her
fight fire with fire  threaten to go to her husband	who either doesnt care or could have me killed  either way natalies still gonna find out
what happens if you level with her	even if she doesnt dump me which is unlikely shed never be able to trust me again
and why should she	look max i made a terrible mistake  one ill never ever make again  natalie and i are soulmates  i know that now  shes the woman i want to spend the rest of my life with  i guess it took the thought of losing her for me to understand that
so youre straight on how this is gonna go down	you set up on lydia  when shes on her way over to the apartment you give me the heads up  i answer the door and pretend to be natalie
she tells you how ive been	a philandering pig
i just dont want natalie to ever find out  she deserves better	howd you get her out of town
she came by the apartment once already fortunately id disconnected the doorbell as a precaution lydias not gonna back off until she gets her pound of flesh	ill give it my best shot
no im serious  that psycho got exactly what she deserved yes	lydia may not have been one of humanitys finer specimens but
shes toxicmonster in bed but toxic	you would be making a mistake to come away from this thinking shes the villain in the piece you are
she was the one	none of this wouldve happened if you had exercised even a smidgen of good judgement or selfrestraint which you didnt
true but	you were trying to have it both ways and you were being completely selfish  and if i ever find out youre going out the back door on natalie again youre the one whos gonna be hanging by your ankles three stories up  understand

well amanda this has been quite a night so far youve seen me and my dick throw up  whats next projectile diarrhea  man what a stud huh	believe it or not you still have a way to go before you start competing with my soontobeexhusband the champion of lousy lovemaking the man who thinks hes the biggest and the best the man who thinks every secretary stewardess and cocktail waitress he fucks should lick his feet for the honor the man for whom faking it was invented christ if i hadnt gotten pregnant with our son i would have never known i even had sex with the prick
you love him	i just told you hes a big hairy
no i mean you love your son	more than anything in the world
and he loves you back doesnt he	hes a little spoiled but i know he does
amanda as ironic as this is gonna sound i cant take any money for im no midnight cowboy yknow it would only cheapen the whole deal for me	im not paying you for the lovemaking hawk i just want you to have whatever you needed the money for when you took me up on my offer
youre a little scrawny but thanks to the concert were low on amateurs name	hawk
you kidding this is detroit drink	yeah a mans drink
whats that	you mean you never seen a jack daniels on the rocks before

whoa she is a killer	amanda finch her ex is one of the wealthiest businessmen in detroit play your cards right and you could hit paydirt she like em young  and since you look a little new at this let me give you three words of advice hard to get think it act it know it be it nothing a woman loves more than when you beat her at her own head games

namely	our band mystery is a quartet and we cant go on the road without our drummer jams mom said something about sending him to st bernards right we gotta bust him out before we go anywhere

whoa she just farted	i have never heard a girl squeeze cheese in my entire life
too bad were stuck in electronics or	never mind with the too bad shit i got a crazy plan but only the craziest among us can pull it off
but but st bernards is way the hell over in the next county	so your moms car has a cb radar detector and cruise control check
we are not stealing my moms car	damn straight we are
hawk all i need is one ding on the volvo and presto there are my balls hanging from the rearview mirror after she gets back from cincinnati	and when is she due back from that groinecologists convention anyway
theres only so much trouble an individual can get into till it just doesnt matter anymore lex you familiar with a condition known as absolute zero	the hypothetical temperature characterized by the absence of heat and even the slightest amount of molecular activity yeah im vaguely familiar
very funny hawk okay im in on this harebrained scheme but if anything happens to my moms car im blaming you ill say you drugged me or something	curly

cool bro now listen up	holy shit i am in absolute trouble i never should have let you drive man absolute fuckin trouble
i think we should try sneaking in	four dudes sneaking in wed get busted fer sure bad plan
okay one of us sneaks in gets four ticket stubs off some kids in the audience comes back out and we all reenter the concerto voila	still too risky for my money  were running out of time here this is kiss a victory for one is a victory for the team im sure i can barter with a scalper but if you dudes think you got better plans go for it well reconvene at that intersection

you look a little scrawny but its worth a shot	i cant just walk in and take my clothes off its embarrasskin
dude if it were dancing the way fred astaire did it id give it my best shot id learn the steps and practice in my spare time but this tribal ritualistic bullshit its waytoospontaneous for me	yeah youre probably too young anyhow

mom whatre we	just keep your lying heathenous trap shut jeremiah
jeremiah whats gotten into you	i just lost my virginity in a confessional booth lord have mercy
forgive me father for i have sinned this is my first confession in well a really long time	prepare to receive the act of penance how many sins have you committed since your last confession
so you see if it wasnt for me me and my friends would be at that kiss concert right now together	thats it
yeah	well this is a unique confession to say the least son and not exactly the most interesting one ive ever heard either you sure you dont want to talk about oh carnal knowledge with a neighborhood girl or impure thoughts about the new student teacher maybe or how about finding a box of magazines under your dads bed
no	well then i suggest you have a seat on the bench behind you and think of something a little juicier to confess than losing kiss tickets i realize this is detroit but i personally find what that rock and roll band is all about to be boring as lucifers kingdom ill return in a little while
okay you better have something really sinful for me this time son my patience is worn to threads and your mom will be here any minute	alright father here it is about two weeks ago i went to my cousins wedding and one of the bridesmaids asked me if i wanted to take a bath
i was insulted so i asked her if i was wreaking some wicked bo right then she said no she wanted to take a bath with me	oh this is terrible please go on
well continue continue	okay when she peeled off that gown youll never guess what she was wearing underneath
no much bet i mean much more sinful than that	a bustier
tell you what you keep guessing and ill say something when you get it	splendid i love a good game of name that nightie
jam has yet to do an overnight with us	i had a nightmare once that something like this might happen i hope he doesnt get grounded again if he misses peter crisss drum solo i dont know if hell be able to handle it
poor jam man imagine having to stash your kiss records inside carly simon album covers no question mrs bruce is a psychobitch from hell	youre one to talk lex your moms a fuckin dyke
trip a female gynecologist does not a lesbian make and even if it did at least my mom didnt give birth to me while she was on lsd	shrooms and even if it was lsd i can still give my mom a kiss without smelling the catch of the day
trip you fuckin asshole	what
yeah right she wishes look at that big ass	you know what they say about a big ass big shit
thats some sick shit right there did she comb your ass hair for you too	if your mom so much as smells those tickets theyre history and we get screwed outta seeing kiss for the third year in a row the third year
hey take it easy man this is the girls crapper remember	wake up lex we just watched jams mom torch our fuckin kiss tickets not reo speedwagon not journey not the bay city rollers kiss if you can think of a better reason to trash a bathroom id sure like to hear it
oh everythings hunkydory now that the shit hit the fan just like you said it would you snug sonofabitch you fuckin jinxed us	smug trip not snug smug

oh yeah you and what army	the kiss army

dont tempt me ill shoot	not if i shoot first
simple simon on the rock go caller	hello is this me im trip am i on the air

yeeeehaaawww this is totally fuckin curly man thank you god	whoa easy trip this is radio not taxi driver now listen up cause this next part is crucial stay on the line so we can get your full name information and
good morning mongrels	good morning
now thats better but i still sense some students out there who are afraid just to say good morning	good morning
hi whats going on here	horrible accident my neighbour he got killed
i feel bad for his family	yeah
dr monnitoff	donnie
so according to hawking wormholes might be able to provide a short cut for jumping between two distant regions of spacetime	so in order to travel back in time youd have to have a big spaceship or something that can travel faster than the speed of light 
a wormhole with an einsteinrosen bridge which is theoretically a wormhole in space controlled by man	so thats it
like a delorean	a metal craft of any kind
what effect do you think this would have on an infant	well the thing is nobody remembers their infancy and anyone who says they do is lying we think that this would help develop memory earlier in life
uhh sure and in order for the vessel to travel through time it must find the portal in this case the wormhole or some unforeseen portal that lies undiscovered	could these wormholes appear in nature
that is highly unlikely youre talking about an act of god	if god controls time then all time is predecided then every living thing travels along a set path
im not following you	if you could see your path or channel growing out of your stomach you could see into the future and thats a form of time travel right
you are contradicting yourself donnie if we could see our destines manifest themselves visually then we would be given the choice to betray our chosen destinies the very fact that this choice exists would mean that all preformed destiny would end	not if you chose to stay within gods channel
when can i squeeze one out	not until like eighth grade
what happens if you tell mom and dad about this samantha	youll put ariel in the garbage disposal
the last unicorn by samantha darko	donnie give it back
thats not what i heard now they think i did it	well if youre innocent then you have nothing to worry about
how can you do that	i can do anything i want and so can you
who is we	youll know soon enough
where did you come from	do you believe in time travel donnie
i want to show you something	you have to do something for me first
why are you wearing that stupid man suit	take it off i want to see you
how much longer is this gonna last	you should already know that  watch the movie donnie i have something to show you
darko cheats death man youre famous i called you like a jillion times last night	we went to a hotel
my dad said he found you on the golf course are you sleepwalking again	i dont wanna talk about it
how old is grandma death	a hundred and one i think every day she does the same thing but theres never any mail
whatd you do donnie whatd you do	go home go home and tell your parents that everything is going to be just fine
wanna walk me home	sure
so you just moved here	yeah my parents got divorced my mom has a restraining order against my stepdad  he has emotional problems
oh i have those too  what kind of problems does your dad have	he stabbed my mom four times in the chest
wow did he go to jail	he fled they still cant find him  my mom and i had to change our names and stuff i thought gretchen sounded kind of cool
im sorry i was in jail once  i accidentally burned down this house it was abandoned i got held back in school again cant drive until im eighteen  i think when i grow up i want to be a painter or maybe a writer or maybe both then ill write a book and draw the illustrations like a comic book you know change things	donnie darko is a cool name sounds like a superhero
i should go for physics monnitoff says i have to write an essay on the greatest invention ever to benefit mankind	thats easy antiseptics
i mean the whole sanitation thing joseph lister 1895 before antiseptics there was no sanitation especially in medicine	you mean soap
dont knock soap without it disease would spread rapidly if we ran out you and i would never live to see the year 2000	wonder where well be then
the best thing about soap is that its the only thing on earth that can never get dirty no matter what crap you throw on it it always rubs off and there it is again perfect	until it withers away
its a good thing the school was flooded today	why is that
youre weird	im sorry
that was a compliment	will you go with me
where are we going	no i mean will you go with me thats like what they call it here going together
where are you going	im going home
so when you sleepwalk can you remember afterward like do you dream	no i just wake up and i look around try to figure out where i am how i got there
its like this big force thats in your brain but sometimes it grows bigger and it spread down into your arms and legs and it just sends you someplace	so when you sleepwalk you go somewhere familiar
what happened to your neck	i dont want to talk about it  so what happened to your neck
thats not good enough youve got to go back in time and take all those hours of darkness and pain and replace them with whatever you wanted	with like images
you know weve been going together for a week and a half	and what
well	you want to kiss me
thats alright i understand	no donnie wait ive never
i always wanted it to be at a time when when it reminds you how beautiful the world can be	yeah and right now theres some fat guy over there watching us
were moving through time	what
they suspended me for two days	are you okay
what how long was i asleep	the whole movie lets go
you want to skip fourth period and go to the ridge	whats wrong with you
my mom is gone	where is she
did you call the cops	yeah they told me to get out of the house
im so scared i just keep thinking that something awful has happened its my fucking stepdad i know it	its safe here
what	theres something you have to know gretchen  everything is going to be just fine
come with me	where are we going
time is running out we have to go see grandma death we have to talk to her	why is this about the book
no frank	whos frank
is that a cellar door	yeah
well life isnt that simple so what if ling ling kept the cash and returned the wallet that has nothing to do with either fear or love	fear and love are the deepest of human emotions
will you still be working at yarn barn cause thats a great place to raise children	no a year of partying is enough shell be going to harvard this fall
youre such a fuckass	when did you stop taking your medication
oh please tell me elizabeth how exactly does one suck a fuck	we will not have this kind of language at the dinner table
i wish i knew where you went at night  did you toilet paper the johnsons house	i stopped rolling houses in the sixth grade mom  get out of my room
you know it would be nice to look at you some time and see my son i dont recognise this person today	then why dont you start taking the goddamn pills
he cant samantha hes been suspended from afterschool activities donnie are you still with us  how was your therapy session tonight	fine you know dr thurman isnt so bad a lady i can tell her anything
i have to take the girls to los angeles tomorrow	do you get to meet ed
if im lucky  so i wont be back until the first your dad will be back on sunday so ive put elizabeth in charge until then she has the car so she can drive you to your therapy tomorrow	how does it feel to have a wacko for a son
so how was school today	it was great we had peanutbutter sandwiches and apples and honey at snacktime and then during showand tell my stuffed walrus was a big hit
know what	where it came from
no apparently they cant tell us what happened yet something about a matching serial number that got burned  but i had to sign a form saying i wouldnt talk to anyone about it	so were not supposed to tell anybody what nobody knows
grandma death	you know roberta sparrow we almost hit her with the car the other day
youre right roberta sparrow was famous for her gem collections kids used to try and steal stuff from her all the time over the years as she got older she became more and more of a recluse now she just likes to stay up there all by herself	i guess she just lost faith in the world
whos been giving you weird looks	a lot of people teachers younger kids its like theyre afraid of me for some reason  but thats ok because i know i deserve it
youre my only son	i know dad
donnie darko perhaps given your recent brush with mass destruction you can give us your opinion	well they say it right when they are ripping the place to shreds when they flood the house that like destruction is a form of creation so the fact that they burn the money is ironic they just want to see what happens when they tear the world apart  they want to change things
who is frank	a sixfoottall bunny rabbit
ms pomeroy whats going on	donnie its friday shouldnt you be off with your friends scaring old people
where are you going	i dont know thats a good question but suffice to say that i am no longer your english teacher they fired me
thats bullshit youre a good teacher	thank you donnie and youre a good student lazy but a good student unlike most of the others you question mom and dads rules
what do i tell the rest of the class when they ask about you	tell them that everything is going to be just fine  it is up to the children to save themselves these days because the parents they dont have a clue
whats cellar door	a famous linguist once said that of all the phrases in the english language of all the endless combinations of words in all of history that cellar door is the most beautiful
so will donnie find his cellar door	i think i already have  but now she wont even talk to me
your mother said that youve been skipping cycles of your medication	ive been taking it i just like to make her feel guilty for all of this you know abuse her psychologically
so i met a new friend	would you like to talk about this friend
i think he saved my life	how so
frank instructed you to get out of bed just before this happened	he said to follow him
do you believe that the world is coming to an end	no  thats stupid
and when i clap my hands twice you will wake up do you understand	yes
so tell me about your day donald	i met a girl
what is her name	gretchen were going together now
do you think a lot about girls	yes
how are things going at school	i think about girls a lot
i asked you about school	i think about fucking a lot during school
what else do you think about during school	i think about whos the boss
who is the boss	i just turn the volume down and think about fucking alyssa milano
what about your family donnie	no i dont think about fucking my family thats sick
how many times have you seen frank	four times so far
can anyone else see him	i dont think so its like a tv station and theyre tuned into mine and no one elses
how does that make you feel	it reminded me of my dog callie
is callie still around	no she died when i was eight we couldnt find her for days she went and crawled underneath our back porch
id like to believe that im not but ive just never seen any proof so i just choose not to bother with it its like i could spend my whole life thinking about it debating it in my head weighing the pros and cons and in the end i still wouldnt have any proof so i dont even debate it any more because its absurd  i dont want to be alone  so does that make me like an atheist	no that makes you keep searching
and they grow out of our stomachs	it was just like she described them in her book like they were alive the way that they looked moved smelled they were like workers assigned to each one of us  i followed my spear and i found something
nothing	have you told gretchen about the spears
whoa  thats ok dr thurman its nothing to be embarrassed about i have sexual fantasies all the time too	i know
i mean gretchen she wont even let me kiss her she says because its our first kiss shes like waiting for this big moment or something i just dont get it i just want to get it over with so we can move on to the good stuff	the good stuff
yeah you know  fucking	have you ever made love donald
and when i clap my hands together twice you will wake up do you understand	yes
so your parents why did you disappoint them	i i was playing with fire
people get hurt	but it was an accident the house was under construction
people get hurt i dont want to hurt anyone	but you were punished
yes i went to jail	do you wish that you were punished by your parents instead
they didnt buy me what i wanted for christmas that year	what did you want for christmas that year
hungry hungry hippos	how did you feel being denied those hungry hungry hippos
regret	what else makes you feel regret
yes i flooded my school and i burned down that perverts house i think i only have a few days left before they catch me	why did you do these things donnie did frank tell you to commit these crimes
i think now that he might	why
i think so i think thats one of the clues its a clue that tells us to keep going	where are we going
where are we going donald	i have the power to build a time machine
how is that possible	grandma death will teach me how soon
what is going to happen	frank is going to kill
i can see him right now	where is he donald
hes right there he can read my mind and hell show me the way out of this the sky is going to open up and then he will reveal himself to me	if the sky were to suddenly open up there would be no law there would be no rule there would only be you and your memories the choices youve made and the people youve touched the life that has been carved out from your subconscious is the only evidence by which you will be judged by which you must judge yourself because when this world ends there will only be you and him and no one else
its too late ive already ruined my life	you will survive this donald i promise you that you will survive you must let me help you  and when i clap my hands together you will wake up
donald an atheist is someone who denies altogether the existence of a god you are an agnostic an agnostic is someone who believes that there can be no proof of the existence of god but does not deny the possibility that god exists	goodbye dr thurman
whoa elizabeth a little hostile there maybe you should be the one in therapy then mom and dad can pay someone two hundred dollars an hour to listen to all of your thoughts so we wont have to	maybe youd like to tell mom and dad why you stopped taking your medication
its called the philosophy of time travel	what does time travel have to do with philosophy
whats her name	youre not gonna tell mom are you
why would i tell mom	because you tell mom everything
no i dont  she worries about you	well dont worry im taking my medication
its not that i mean mouthing off to your teachers ill admit when dad told me what you said to ms farmer i laughed my ass off	i was just being honest
yeah well thats not the way the world works if you keep being too honest the world will eventually find a way to destroy you	her name is gretchen
i got in im going to harvard	congratulations
mom and dad wont be back until sunday night its halloween carnival we should throw a party we could totally get away with it	okay but it has to be a small one
how much are they paying you to be here	excuse me whats your name son
thank you for seeing us we just felt that it was time to discuss	what i think is going on with your son
frank the giant bunny rabbit	frank
donnie is experiencing what is commonly called a daylight hallucination	youre telling me my son has an imaginary friend
i what can we do	i would like to put him through more hypnotherapy and increase his medication
if thats what you think is necessary	but let me remind you that this treatment is experimental
our son just called me a bitch	youre not a bitch
what	frankie feedler you remember him from high school

my purse has been stolen  the plans of war are in it	what  
i  i may be wrong but i suspect the secretary of war	dont bother me  im thinking  what was that
i said  i suspect the secretary of war	this is treason  what a fool i was to listen to your siren song and fall a helpless victim under the insidious spell of your irresistible charms 
but 	you satisfied your selfish whims while nations tottered dynasties rocked and the world plunged headlong into a chasm of chaos and oblivion   not bad eh
you know i think they think i should be king  although it would please me to govern the throng suppose i were king and then everything went wrong	the king can do no wrong
your uncle has been such a friend to us in every crisis  without his countrys financial aid 	what is money  mrs teasdale for you  i would do anything
ambassador  i am so anxious for you to meet our new dictator	mrs teasdale  no matter who rules freedonia to me you will always be the first lady of the land
but would further cement the relations of our countries	ambassador trentino i am indeed honored  but you see  well  i 
oh  then there his somebody else	well no  not exactly  but 
gentlemen  gentlemen	i didnt come here to be insulted
i shall report this indignity the my president  mrs teasdale  i feel this regrettable occurrence will plunge our countries into war	this is terrible
mrs teasdale im willing to pocket my pride and do anything i can to make up with his excellency	oh would you
so thats the one you want to marry	with mrs teasdale as my wife and freedonia under my control  
maybe its not going to be so easy from what ive heard mrs teasdale is rather sweet on this rufus t firefly	thats where you come in  ill leave him in your hands and dont forget youre supposed to be my niece
uncle you cant do this	my dear niece  i must ask you not to interfere  war is not a womans problem
fine nothing  i didnt want war my plan was to marry mrs teasdale and overthrow firefly	maybe you can still win the old dame over  why not try to 
one or two	two please
and here is one of fredericks mother	how lovely
they have noble faces	ive always thought that myself
oh why mr merrick shes beautiful	she has the face of an angel she was an angel she was so kind so kind to me its not her fault for in the fourth month of her maternal condition she was knocked down by an elephant im sure i must have been a great disappointment to her
did it go well darling	yes very well i think are the girls in bed
yes and they send their kisses would you like your sherry now	no i think a whiskey
freddie freddie dont look so discouraged	i shouldnt be we made great progress today i taught him to repeat a few basic phrases he did rather well too but i had to lead him every step of the way though frankly at times i was unsure of who was leading whom
what do you mean	well i wasnt sure whether he was parroting me because thats all he was capable of or whether he sensed that thats all i wanted to hear and he was trying to please me
but i thought you said that he was rather simple	he is i mean ive always thought he was i think he must be is he simple or is that just something ive wished upon him to make things simpler for myself
frederick why are you so interested in this particular case	i dont know i cant explain it if this is an intelligent man trapped in the body of a monster then im under a moral obligation to help free that mind free that spirit as best i can to help him live as full and content a life as possible but if hes an imbecile whos body i cant treat and whos mind i cant touch well then my obligation is discharged they can put him where they will he wont be bothered i wont be bothered and everyones conscience can remain free and untroubled and that is my dilemma what is in his mind
perhaps youre just polishing a stone endowing this elephant man with qualities he doesnt possess	and what qualities are those intelligence or stupidity
im sorry i dont know either i just dont know	well these things take time
you stay with me	dinner will be served shortly dear
freddie whats the matter youve been like this all evening	oh ive just been thinking about something that man bytes said
oh freddie what could that wretched vampire say to upset you	that i am very little different from him
oh thats absurd frederick no no frederick thats all wrong john is happier and more fulfilled now than he has ever been in his entire life and that is completely due to you	but why did i do it what was this all for so john merrick could live out his last days in peace and comfort or so i could become famous
excuse me mr treves sir	yes
i found it	did you see it
our man is sick come right away	what is it
like this 	ill get my bag
hes doing it to spite me i tell you and its got to stop	hes sick bytes hes going to die
what are you going to do	ill show you ill show you
dont	shut up
what happened	he fell  he falls
hes a clumsy git never watches where he is going	why is he sitting up like this he needs rest
this man belongs in hospital	cant you fix him up here hes my livelihood listen
i want my man back	just a moment how did you get in here
never mind that i want my man	hes still very sick please come downstairs with me ill explain the situation
dont dont muck me about youve had plenty of time to fix him up and hes leaving with me now do you understand me now mr treves we had a bargain	you misunderstood this man suffered a severe fall if you take my meaning hes my patient now and i must do what
pull the other one why dont you we made a deal	i know what youve done to him and hes never going back to that
hes a freak thats how they live were partners him and i business partners youre willfully deprivin me of my livlihood	all you do is profit from another mans misery
i want him back	so you can beat him so you can starve him a dog in the street would fare better with you
now i think we really do understand one another	right right
youve acquired a taste for this	its quite nutritious sir
dont be frightened he wont hurt you	indeed
a hospital is no place for secrecy mr treves doctors spiriting hooded figures about are liable to cause comment why wasnt this patient properly admitted and why is he in isolation is he contagious	no sir hes got bronchitis and hes been badly beaten
why isnt he in the general ward then	well sir hes quite seriously deformed and i fear the other patients would find him rather shocking
deformed is that it then am i to assume that he is ultimately incurable	yes sir
what are your plans then treves you are aware that the london does not accept incurables the rules are quite clear on that point	yes im well aware of that but this case is quite exceptional
oh is he a friend of yours	no more of an acquaintance
i certainly sympathize with your problem treves why dont you try the british home or the royal hospital for perhaps they would have a place for him	yes sir ill look into that  would you like to meet him sir
have you contacted the british home and the royal hospital	ah no sir i had planned to see them in the morning
good how is the patient	hes doing very well in fact thats why i came to see you i think that if i were to present mr merrick to the hospital committee then they would have a chance to see for themselves not only the extraordinary nature of the disease but of the man as well if the committee had a chance to speak with him hear him say a few words for himself im sure they would see him as a patient rather than as a violation of the rules
i really dont think thats necessary treves im quite sure the committee will be able to make an equitable decision on the merits of the case such as they are	i dont agree no one can make a reasonable decision about this mans future without at least meeting him no doctor would presume to diagnose a patient he had never met
no treves its out of the question now if it was up to me id say certainly lets meet the fellow by all means im sorry i simply cant speak for the other members of the committee	then will you meet him as a representative of the committee
singularly unpleasant chap uh i dont suppose there would be any harm in my meeting your patient mr treves	thank you very much sir shall we say in a few days then
two oclock then you know treves it seems this acquaintance of yours has become rather more than just an acquaintance	yes sir
its only a physical problem he has trouble with certain sounds because of the constrictive deformity of the mouth but he can talk and has a great eagerness to make contact with people who will let him so if you have any difficulty understanding what he is saying just tell me and ill make it clear	speaking is one thing treves but can the man comprehend
it was a nice try treves but the man is so obviously mouthing your words	yes im very sorry to have wasted your time sir i just felt that i had to do anything i could to protect him
treves well done	not me sir mr merrick he succeeded in spite of my shortsightedness
you are quite right treves this is an exceptional case and i quite agree that the committee should see mr merrick	i could easily arrange
no not that way broadneck and the others dont like to deal with patients directly it makes them queasy do you have any photographs of mr merrick	well yes
excellent we shall present them along with the other particulars of the case to the committee i want them to see exactly how horribly his body has been affected you and i shall vouch for his inner qualities	do you think theyll go along with us
dont we	no we dont their committees have informed me that theyre unwilling to take mr merrick even if they were supplied with funds they dont want him
has the response picked up	frankly treves its not what id expected a few small cheques well wishers dont worry these things undoubtedly take time
but hes so afraid hes going to be carted off ive promised him that wont happen	well ill let you know if theres something in the afternoon post
dont you think this is a bit premature we dont have the backing yet to	steady on treves have a seat
how are you feeling today	i feel much better thank you for asking and you
im feeling very fit thank you how is your bronchitis	i feel much better thank you
are you comfortable here	everyone has been very kind i am extremely grateful
i everyone has been very kind to me	of course how long did you and mr treves prepare for this interview
everyone has been very kind	yes of course well its been a pleasure meeting you mr merrick good day
what is it treves	thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies thou anointest my head with oil
how long has this man been here	three quarters of an hour
abominable things these machines one cant reason with them	what a mess
i say freddie what are you about	oh nothing nothing of any great importance
good lord freddie what have you got in there	youll know presently at the meeting of the society but until then i beg of you fox keep it to yourself
certainly if you insist you must have quite a find there	i dont know what ive got
you never mentioned his mental state	hes imbecile no doubt from birth he speaks but its all gibberish no the mans a homeless idiot  i pray god hes an idiot
fair katharine and most fair will you vouchsafe to teach a soldier terms such as will enter at a ladys ear and plead his lovesuit to her gentle heart	your majesty shall mock at me i cannot speak your england
o fair katharine if you will love me soundly with your french heart i will be glad to hear you confess it brokenly with your english tongue do you like me kate	pardonnezmoi i cannot tell vat is like me
an angel is like you kate and you are like an angel	o bon dieu les langues des hommes sont pleines de tramperies
what say you fair one that the tongues of men are full of deceits	oui dat de tongues of de mans is be full of deceits
good day	ive brought you some things i hope youll like mr merrick i hope you dont think it too forward
i want you to know that i dont go about giving my pictures to just anyone	oh no i would never think it its so beautiful you are so ill give it a place of honor here next to my mother
shes very pretty your mother	yes
mr treves says that you are in the theatre do you live there	oh no mr merrick i just work there
well even to work there would be wonderful is it beautiful	youve never been
alas no	well you must go it is one of the most beautiful places on earth of course im rather partial
tell me about it please	its very difficult to put into a nutshell but i should say the theater is the shrine of the imagination where one may suspend disbelief and travel anywhere in the world to any time you desire you may look over the shoulders of kings unobserved battle with ruthless tyrants and marry the beautiful princess all in the space of a few hours onstage you may be whoever you wish to be do anything you please and always always live happily ever after the theatre is all the brightest and best things of the world mr merrick it is lights and music gaiety and joy its well its romance
romance	thats one thing the theatre has in great store which reminds me i have something else for you
have you read it	no but i certainly shall
have not saints lips and holy palmers too	ay pilgrim lips that they must use in prayer
why mr merrick youre not an elephant man at all	oh no
john id like you to meet one of the brightest lights of the british stage mrs kendal mrs kendal john merrick	good day mr merrick
its all arranged ill send over some evening gowns for the sisters that you select to accompany mr merrick youll be using the royal entrance and princess alexandra herself will be there to welcome him to her private box	im very grateful to you mrs kendal this is just the thing to help him forget his ordeal john will be very excited
how awful for john	and yet not once have any of us heard him complain
is he dying then	yes there is nothing more frustrating nothing that makes a physician feel more useless than standing by watching his patient deteriorate and when that patient is a friend no no theres absolutely nothing i can do
well its all quite ive never heard its quite	yes

good morning mr treves itll be his bathtime soon has he eaten	not quite yet mrs mothershead there seems to be some difficulty this morning
wont come out eh	no hes very upset about something
hes had his share of smacks mothershead i expect thats what drives him under the bed we must use patience and understanding with this man	perhaps youve got the time for that mr treves i certainly dont ive got an entire hospital to look after and you have your real patients dont waste your time with him sir its like talking to a wall i dont mean to be harsh but truthfully what can you do for him ill be back later for his bath and mr carr gomm would like to see you when you have a moment good day sir
good lord mr treves	weve made tremendous strides today mothershead he listens and repeats with great attention and this certainly isnt easy for him
oh well quickly please mothershead im overdue	i cant understand why you let those people go in there sir
now mothershead you have to understand that this is very good for john he relishes contact with people outside the hospital	but you saw them sir they couldnt hide their disgust they dont care anything for john theyre just trying to impress their friends
arent you being just a little harsh mothershead you yourself hardly treated john with much loving kindness when he first arrived	i bathed him didnt i i fed him and cleaned up after him if loving kindness can be called care and practical concern then yes i did treat him with loving kindness and im not ashamed to say it
mr treves some more books arrived for mr merrick	thank you mothershead have a porter put them in my office
yes sir  whats that	a dressing bag
a dressing bag	you dont think its too gaudy do you
well	john thinks its very dashing something no gentleman should be without im inclined to agree
so you see john theres no need for a lighthouse all your friends are here	welcome home john
where is mr merrick	i i dont know what you mean sir
you bastard you tortured him you tortured him you bastard where is he	youre not listening to me i aint done nothing wrong people pay to see your monster mr treves i just take the money

those things in your hands	these what are these theyre swords
what	put them down  please make them put them down

what does that matter but youve youve felt like this before	it was different
but you loved her all the same	we never went to bed together
why do you go on about that what does it matter	youve been to bed with somebody else havent you
ive never loved anybody	ive never been to bed with anybody
the cloak invisible it was my mothers parting gift	the fifth one this week
oh for goodness sake	and i thought you said it was something special
thats just what i was trying to tell you you are	five this week how many the week before
we mustnt let him land	who
just give me a hand	i mean you could have killed yourself
wheres the cloak invisible	why
erik you dont understand	no its you who doesnt understand aud halfdan has come to kill and destroy we brought him here we must stop him
but you dont realize	goodbye aud
and thanks for the cloak invisible	no wait erik the cloak the cloak invisible it only seems to work on my father
no no we are in the spell of the horn hatred will destroy us	thats right
no dont look the abyss will suck away your strength	i must look keitel hold this
you still want to go to asgaard	of course
do you believe i love you	i but i
you dont have to love me just do you believe i love you	yes  i believe you do
the second note	the second note to wake the gods
erik youve done what you came to do	not quite
blow the third note the note to take us home	there is something i must ask the gods
then i shall come too	no no
i dont want to live without you	but aud i i came to find someone
loki where did you come from	halfdan wanted to stop you waking the gods so i disguised myself to sabotage their plans
but 	it was my master keitels idea
how do we know this is the way	we blew the horn resounding
now what can you want with me erik the viking	i shouldnt have come
what do you see erik	i see the world
is it night or day erik	it is day of course freya
have you ever seen the sun erik	the sun is up beyond the clouds  where it always is
but have you ever seen it think back	of course not but when i was a child i remember a dream it was as if the whole sky was blue
is there nothing men can do	the gods are asleep erik
and will the dead ever return freya	that i cannot tell you
no we dont	the gods decreed that if ever a sword spills human blood upon these shores the whole of hybrasil will sink beneath the waves
how	well for a start er theres no killing
well obviously theres no killing	well isnt it great
would you like us to sing to you	thats very kind of you but were in rather a hurry were
you dont think our singings going to be good enough for you	oh no no no its just the horn resounding is
a lot of people like our singing	im sure its lovely
but you dont want to hear it	no no  wed love to hear it wouldnt we
er well we we would be terribly grateful if you all would sing for us	youre just saying that
of course were not wed genuinely like to hear you sing	really
really	and youre not just saying it because you think we want you to
no 	right summon the musicians well do the one that goes tumtumtum tumtitumtum
were just not a very musical nation	no no it was very er nice
the gods are asleep king arnulf	you try to be nice to people when theyre rude about your singing
ill tell you what	yes
careful  theyre not supposed to hurt you	youve got to let me go
its all part of our safety regulations you see if someone were to get hurt they might get angry and then well	theyll be more than hurt if halfdan the black lands ow
hes trying to stop us waking the gods	why
because thats how he makes his money by war and plunder	dont talk nonsense
he wants to kill us	not when we explain about the great blessing
you dont know halfdan the black	i know that the great blessing has kept the peace for a thousand years and will keep it for the next thousand
well its not called the horn resounding for nothing  you do know how to play the horn dont you	yes oh yes
but it is look	the important thing is not to panic
have you done this sort of thing before	me of course ive been looting and pillaging up and down the coast
looting and pillaging eh	yes
what about the raping	shut up
its obvious you havent raped anyone in your life	sh
of course i like women i love em	you dont love me

oh well  youve got to do them	why why have you got to go round killing and looting
oh stop talking as if we were married	well you started it
i just said i didnt feel like raping you	and i was just saying that rape is no more pointless or crude than all the killing and looting that goes on
scream	ah
thanks for saving me from a fate worse than death	i didnt mean to
you told them i raped you  why	i dunno you looked so so vulnerable
ive come to take you back to the land of the living	what a stupid idea
why	whats the point of being dead in the land of the living
have you tried to ask the god for anything	well no
why should you care	i dont know i just did
find the rainbow bridge	find it and cross it
but what	but

if this is the age of ragnarok keitel blacksmith it is good to us	cant make enough swords
cant make enough axeheads	but keitel if erik ever finds the horn resounding if he ever crosses bifrost the rainbow bridge if he ever wakens the gods
they chase fenrir the wolf from the sky	the age of ragnarok ends
the bottom falls out of the sword business	its not just your livelihood thats at stake but your sons and the livelihood of all blacksmiths
the blacksmiths code says i must	honour and protect all blacksmiths

frost	yeah im not like a robert frost lover by any stretch his stuff seems strictly grade school to me but this made me cry for some reason maybe because it is grade school yknow
its pretty	i miss grade school i dont know why im calling it grade school all of a sudden when i went we called it elementary school but i like grade school better sounds like something someone from the forties would call it id like to be from then everyone wore hats anyway cheers
god that feels so fucking good take yours off	im fine
what do you want to hear	you pick it
you just say im not really 	i dont know i cant see them from here joel just pick something good
well i should probably get going	no stay just for a little while  refill
no i 	i know a man who needs a refill
thanks	drink up young man itll make the whole seduction part less repugnant
me neither but sometimes i have premonitions so i dont know maybe thats just coincidence right yknow you think something and then it happens or you think a word and then someone says it yknow	yeah i dont know its hard to know
exactly exactly thats exactly my feeling about it its hard to know like okay but how many times do i think something and it doesnt happen thats what youre saying right you forget about those times right	yeah i guess
but i think i am i like to think i am	its helpful to think theres some order to things youre kind of closed mouthed arent you
sorry my life isnt that interesting i go to work i go home i dont know what to say	oh  does that make you sad or anxious im always anxious thinking im not living my life to the fullest yknow taking advantage of every possibility just making sure that im not wasting one second of the little time i have
i like you thats the thing about my psychic thing i think thats my greatest psychic power that i get a sense about people my problem is i never trust it but i get it and with you i get that youre a really good guy	thanks
and anyway you sell yourself short i can tell theres a lot of stuff going on in your brain i can tell my goal can i tell you my goal	yeah
whats the goal joel  my goal joel is to just let it flow through me do you know what i mean its like theres all these emotions and ideas and they come quick and they change and they leave and they come back in a different form and i think were all taught we should be consistent yknow you love someone  thats it forever you choose to do something with your life  thats it thats what you do its a sign of maturity to stick with that and see things through and my feeling is thats how you die because you stop listening to what is true and what is true is constantly changing you know	yeah i think so its hard to 
youre very nice god i have to stop saying that youre nervous around me huh	no
im nervous you dont need to be nervous around me though i like you do you think im repulsively fat	no not at all
well for the last week anyway hes kind of a kid kind of a goofball but hes really stuck on me which is flattering who wouldnt like that and hes like a dope but he says these smart and moving things sometimes out of nowhere that just break my heart hes the one who gave me that crow photograph	oh yeah
that made me cry but anyway we went up to boston because i had this urge to lie on my back on the charles river it gets frozen this time of year	thats scary sounding
exactly i used to do it in college and i had this urge to go do it again so i got patrick and we drove all night to get there and he was sweet and said nice things to me but i was really disappointment to be there with him yknow and thats where psychic stuff comes in like it just isnt right with him yknow	i think so

i told her today i need to end it	is that what you want
yeah	id like to take you out or something
well youre married	not yet not married
joel im not a concept i want you to just keep that in your head too many guys think im a concept or i complete them or im going to make them alive but im just a fuckedup girl who is looking for my own peace of mind dont assign me yours	i remember that speech really well
i know	it would be different if we could just give it another go around
hi there	hi
you said	i saw you sitting over here by yourself i thought thank god someone normal who doesnt know how interact at these things either
yeah i dont ever know what to say	i cant tell you how happy i am to hear that i mean i dont mean im happy youre uncomfortable but yknow im such a loser every time i come to a party i tell myself im going to be different and its always exactly the same and then i hate myself after for being such a clod
im clementine can i borrow a piece of your chicken	and you picked it out of my plate before i could answer and it felt so intimate like we were already lovers
oh god how horrid	im joel
you mean like  oh my darlin oh my darlin oh my darlin clementine  huckleberry hound that sort of thing	yeah like that
this is it joel its gonna be gone soon	i know
what do we do	enjoy it say goodbye
you should try xanax i mean its a chemical and all but it works and it works just having it around knowing that its there like insurance	yeah
ill give you a couple see what you think	okay
have you ever read any anna akhmatova	i love her
really me too i dont meet people who even know who she is and i work in a book store	i think shes great
me too theres this poem 	did this conversation come before or after we saw the house
i think before	seems too coincidental that way
do you know her poem that starts seaside gusts of windand a house in which we dont live	yeah yeah it goes perhaps there is someone in this world to whom i could send all these lines
i wish we did you married	um no
i do sort of live with somebody though	oh
male or female	female
cool	what are you doing
cmon man the waters fine nobodys coming here tonight believe me this place is closed up electricitys off	i hesitated for what seemed like forever
i knew	i knew by your nervousness that naomi wasnt the kind of girl who forced you to criminally trespass
its dark	yeah whats your girlfriends name
so go	i did i walked out the door i felt like i was a scared little kid i thought you knew that about me i ran back to the bonfire trying to outrun my humiliation you said so go with such disdain
what if you stay this time	i walked out the door theres no more memory
bye joel	i love you
so youll call me right	yeah
when	tomorrow
tonight just to test out the phone lines	yeah
i dont know what if it breaks	what if
i think i should go back	joel come here please
listen did you want to make love	make love
have sex yknow 	oh um
because i just am not drunk enough or stoned enough to make that happen right now	thats okay i 
im sorry i just wanted to say that this seems like the perfect romantic exotic place to do it and 	hey joel 
 and im just too nervous around you right now	im nervous too
yeah i wouldnt have thought that	well you obviously dont know me
a bully moi	thats what it says you drank too much you picked on me for being passive and timid
well sounds like me sorry man  says you were jealous and suspicious	says you would sometimes disappear all night then brag to me about your sexual conquests
did i use the term sexual conquests or is that your way of putting it	i dont know
doesnt sound like me	says you were a slob leaving trails of panties and dirty socks in your wake
says you were constantly calling me a slob  its sexy that we were like a married couple griping and overlyfamiliar and bored dont you think	i sort of do but i only see it as a fantasy version of reality cleaned up enough to be erotic
youre still excited by my irreverence you havent yet started to think of it as my gratuitous need to shock	i cant stop thinking about you
yay meet me after work by the old mill	what old mill is that somewhere we 
what took you so long	i just walked in
hmmm do you miss me	oddly enough i do
ha ha you said i do i guess that means were married	i guess so
yeah	did you send this is it a joke
i probably got the same thing as you	i mean i havent even told anyone ive met you who would even know to do this
maybe its true then its my voice on the tape	thats what you have to say how could it be true i never even heard of any procedure like this its a joke
its true	i know i spoke to my friend magda
look i have to go i have to think	joel weve fucked weve made love like a million times and we were so sweet and shy and inept with each other last night isnt that lovely
hi its joel	hey lover whatcha doing
im just yknow passing the time best i can till i can see you	god i cant believe i ever hated you
you must have been crazy	guess what im wearing
i dont know panties and 	your dried cum
hi naomi its joel	hi
hows it going	good i called you at work today they said you were home sick
i know i had to take the day to think	yeah i tried you at home did you get my message
i just got in	long day thinking
it was snowing	there are two of them couldnt make them out the orange glow of a cigarette
the driver waved so casual friendly	im like a joke to them
i might be making a mistake	maybe im making a mistake maybe i just need to learn to live with this first of all ill get over it secondly it happened those who do not remember history are condemned to repeat it who said that churchill im not sure but i dont care she did it to me i have to rid myself of this fuck her
pink  there was a number on it i remember al 1718  i have to follow through with this i have no choice	the pill was pink i remember it had some letters and numbers on it what were they al 1718 al something four digits i dont like taking pills when i dont know what they are i have no choice
i should maybe talk to you	clementine i should just maybe talk to her
clementine	thats your look for me
gotta get home how could she do this to me how could she not care about what we meant to each other what a fuck what a fucking monster she is	oh god i miss her i cant believe shes with that guy now im never going to see her again i love her so much what a fucking monster she is
right she called me an old lady here too and i remember i said	and what are you like a wino
hows the chicken	is that like us are we just bored with each other
shes so sexy	i loved you on this day i love this memory the rain us just hanging
i cant i have to go home ill do it later	i didnt want to do this but i had to or they wouldve called me a girl
naomi	on the couch dark quiet i wondered if i had made a terrible mistake i almost reached for the phone about a thousand times i thought i could take it back erase it explain i had momentarily lost my mind then i told myself we werent happy that was the truth that what we were was safe it was unfair to you and to me to stay in a relationship for that reason i thought about clementine and the spark when i was with her but then i thought what you and i had was real and adult and therefore significant even if it wasnt much fun but i wanted fun i saw other people having fun and i wanted it then i thought fun is a lie that no one is really having fun im being suckered by advertising and movie bullshit then i thought maybe not maybe not and then i thought as i always do at this point in my argument about dying
your back to me in that orange sweatshirt i would come to know so well and even hate eventually at the time i thought how cool an orange sweatshirt	i remember being drawn to you even then i thought i love this woman because shes alone down there looking out at the black ocean
so youre still on the zoloft	next thing i remember we were walking down near the surf
clementine	i couldnt believe you did that i was paralyzed with fear
i really should go i really need to catch my ride	i didnt want to go i was too nervous i thought maybe you were a nut but you were exciting you called from upstairs
well start with your most recent memories and go backwards  there is an emotional core to each of our memories  as we eradicate this core it starts its degradation process  by the time you wake up in the morning all memories weve targeted will have withered and disappeared like a dream upon waking	is there any sort of risk of brain damage
im sorry you saw one of our notification cards you never should have	well i did
we can help you through this why dont you start now by telling me everything you can remember about 	you have to stop this
what what do you mean	im trapped in my head and everything i love is being erased stop it now
yours	you take it i dont know
so whats going on joel	i dont know ive just been thinking maybe were not happy with each other
what	yknow weve been i dont know sort of unhappy with each other and 
bullshit who is it you met someone	no i just need some space maybe
the thing is joel whatever it is you think you have with this chick once the thrill wears off youre just going to be joel with the same fucking problems	its not somebody else

mary people come to him voluntarily	i wont allow it those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it what do you think of that thats from my quote book

mary has stolen our files and is sending them back to people	jesus
oh hi	hi i was in the neighborhood and thought id see 
i think hes in a conference unfortunately im really sorry	would you just try him you never know as long as im here you never know
this book  its essential that people read it because    its the truth and only i know it	maybe after the holidays then
the voltage looks fine	then check the connections

its an apartment	not a dump then but kind of plain uninspired and theres a stale smell sort of stuffy i dont know stuffy
patrick lets just get through this we have a long night ahead of us	yeah
i like mary i like when she comes to visit i just dont think she likes me	she likes you okay
i wonder if i should invite my girlfriend over too i have a girlfriend now	you can if you want
did i tell you i have a new girlfriend	this ones history moving on
the thing is my situation is a little weird my girlfriend situation	patrick we need to focus
she was beautiful so sweet and funky and voluptuous i kind of stole a pair of her panties is what	jesus patrick
mary hates me ive never been popular with the ladies	maybe if you stopped stealing their panties
i can handle it hes pretty much on autopilot anyway	thanks stan i owe you
what was that	clockworks
the clockworks is one reason that i am here on siwash ridge i accepted the invitation to be initiated as a shaman by an aged siwash chief who was the principle outside confederate of the clock people	siwash huh
but unlike the clockworks of the clock people my ticks more accurately echo the ticks of the universe  ha ha ho ho and hee hee	the clock people
during the second world war i busted out of tule lake detention camp as a japaneseamerican i had been put there and watched over i found refuge with the clock people who discovered me in a snow bank near dead i had been climbing across the sierra nevada mountains	then if you are japanese then why are you called the chink
what do you believe in then	ha ha ho ho and hee hee
is everything getting worse	yes everything is getting worse but everything is also getting better
i want to go back to the clock people i kind of miss those fool redskins and wonder what theyre up to whats happened to jelly	she had a one wayticket to kansas city
well if the clock people give you any inside information on the end of the world drop us a postcard	the world isnt going to end you dummy i hope you know that much  but it is going to change its going to change drastically and probably in your lifetime the clock people see calamitous earthquakes as the agent of change and they may be right since there are a hundred thousand earthquakes a year and major ones are long overdue but there are far worse catastrophes coming unless the human race can bring itself to abandon the goals and values of civilization in other words unless it can break the consumption habit  and we are so conditioned to consuming as a way of life that for most of us life would have no meaning without the yearnings and rewards of progressive consumption it isnt merely that our bad habits will cause global catastrophes but that our operative politicaleconomic philosophies have us in such a blind crab grip that they prevent us from preparing for the natural disasters that are not our fault so the apocalyptic shit is going to hit the fan all right but therell be some of us itll miss little pockets of humanity like the clock people like you two honeys if you decide to accept my offer of a lease on siwash cave theres almost no worldwide calamity  famine nuclear accident plague weather warfare or reduction of the ozone shield  that you couldnt survive in that cave
suppose that you bear five or six children with your characteristics all in siwash cave in a postcatastrophe world your offspring would of necessity intermarry forming in time a tribe a tribe every member of which had giant thumbs a tribe of big thumbs would relate to the environment in very special ways it could not use weapons or produce sophisticated tools it would have to rely on its wits and its senses it would have to live with animals  and plants  as virtual equals its extremely pleasant to me to think about a tribe of physical eccentrics living peacefully with animals and plants learning their languages perhaps and paying them the respect they deserve	how am i going to be the progenitor of a tribe when im living on an isolated ridgetop with delores
where do you live miss hankshaw	im staying with the countess
i know but where do you reside when you arent visiting new york	i dont
you dont	well no i dont reside anywhere in particular i just keep moving
where are the others	oh rupert and carla had a little hassle and went home
welcome podner by god its great to have you here its an honor sorry i took so long getting to you but weve had a mess of hard work these past few days  and a heap of planning to do	er you seem to know who i am and maybe even what i am thanks for the breakfast
tell me about it	about
about being a cowgirl whats it all about when you say the word you make it sound like it was painted in radium on the side of a pearl	cowgirls exist as an image a fairly common image the idea of cowgirls especially for little girls prevails in our culture therefore it seems to me the existence of cowgirls should prevail otherwise theyre being fooled in the rodeo hall of fame in oklahoma city there are just two cowgirls two and both of em are trickriders trickriding is what cowgirls have almost always done in rodeos our society sure likes to see its unconventional women do tricks thats what prostitutes call it you know tricking
youre political then	no maam no way theres girls on the rubber rose who are political but i dont share their views i got no cowgirl ideology to expound politics is for people who have a passion for changing life but lack a passion for living it
did that last comment sound too profound to be coming outta my mouth its not original its something i picked up from the chink	really the chink huh ive gathered that you sometimes speak with him what else have you learned from the chink
delores zonks out on peyote at least once a week but so far her third vision hasnt happened niwetkame the mother goddess has not gotten back in touch with her meanwhile she and debbie are rivaling each other like a couple of crosstown high schools tension cowgirl tension what a drag	what is debbies position
debbie says that if women are to take charge again they must do it in the feminine way they mustnt resort to aggressive and violent masculine methods she says it is up to women to show themselves better than men to love men set good examples for them and guide them tenderly toward the new age shes a real dreamer that debbiedear	you dont agree with debbie then
looks like every time we get together things are in a mess	so be it it looks serious this time though all these guns are you actually prepared to kill and die for whooping cranes
hell no the cranes are wonderful okay but im not in this for whooping cranes im in it for cowgirls if we cowgirls give in to authority on this crane issue then cowgirls become just another compromise i want a finer fate than that  for me and for every other cowgirl better no cowgirls at all than cowgirls compromised	how did this business get started anyhow why are the birds nesting here
extraordinary	shes obviously that jesus which would you rather have a million dollars or one of sissys thumbs full of pennies
oh you im not talking about her hands theyre difficult to ignore i confess but im speaking of her whole being her whole being is extraordinary the way she talks for example shes so articulate	its high time you realized honey babe that a woman doesnt have to give the best years of her life to radcliffe or smith in order to speak the english language
i think shes disappointed that im not more ah sort of atavistic shes got some naive sentimental notions about indians im sure she liked me though but then she left town	she always leaves town you dummy that doesnt mean anything what about in bed how does she like it in bed
how does she like what in bed	like what
what do you think	well er
shit o dear julian do you mean to tell me you didnt get it on	oh we didnt get it all the way on
what do they do to you boys in those ivy league schools anyway strap you down and pump the nature out of you they can even press the last drop of nature out of a mohawk buck why send a shaman or cannibal to yale for four years and all hed be fit for would be a desk in the militaryindustrial complex and a seat in the third row at a neil simon comedy jesus hms christ if harvard or princeton could get hold of the chink for a couple of semesters theyd turn him into a candidate for the bow tie wing of the hall of wimps oogie boogie	if we ivy leaguers arent earthy enough to suit you hillbillies at least we dont go around indulging in racist terms such as chink next thing i know youll be calling me chief
chinks the guys name for christs sake	what guy
im cold	here ill turn down the air conditioner
what are you doing	getting dressed ive got to go
but i dont want you to leave please stay we can go to dinner i owe you a dinner and tonight we can really make love	i have to go julian
why why do you have to go	my thumbs hurt ive made a mistake ive been negligent i havent exercised i have to hitchhike a little bit every day no matter what its like a musician practicing his scales when i dont practice my timing gets off my thumbs get stiff and sore
going north	you bet your raggedy white ass i am
are you in show business	i was a successful model once
for magazines	i was the yoni yum femininehygiene dew girl from 1965 to 1970 but got laid off
so now youre bummin around	yep
hitchhiking	im the best
youre the best	when i was younger i hitchhiked one hundred and twentyseven hours without stopping without food or sleep crossed the continent twice in six days cooled my thumbs in both oceans and caught rides after midnight on unlighted highways
whooee	as i developed however i grew more concerned with subtleties and nuances of style time in terms of mph no longer interested me i began to hitchhike in something akin to geological time slow ancient vast when i am really moving stopping car after car after car moving so freely so clearly so delicately that even the sex maniacs and the cops can only blink and let me pass then i embody the rhythms of the universe i am in a state of grace
to my own special sissy cheers and welcome so my letter brought ya flying eh where were you salt lake city la conner well i may have a little surprise for you but first tell me about yourself its been six months hasnt it in some circles thats half a year how are you	tired
thats the very first time in the eons that ive known you that ive ever heard you complain and now youre tired poor darling	a born freak can only go uphill
freak schmeek most of us are freaks in one way or another try being born a male russian countess into a white middle class baptist family in mississippi and youll see what i mean	ive always been proud of the way nature singled me out its the people who have been deformed by society i feel sorry for ive been steady moving for eleven years and some months maybe i should rest up for a spell im not as young as i used to be
shit o goodness you wont be thirty for another year and youre more beautiful than ever	does that mean you might have an assignment for me
if you dont want me to pose for him why do you want me to meet him	purely personal i believe you might enjoy one another
but here you are still a virgin  you are virginal yet arent you	why yes technically jack kerouac and i came awfully close but he was afraid of me i think
yes well what im getting at is that there comes a time when it is psychologically impossible for a woman to lose her virginity she cant wait too long you know now theres no reason why you must lose yours i mean just ponder it a bit thats all	what makes you think this watercolorist and i would develop a romantic relationship
i cant be certain that you would but what have you got to lose	well okay ill try it i dont see the point in it but ill try it just for you its kind of silly actually me going out with an artist in new york city however
sissy dont play dumb with me youre a good model but a shitty actress the cowgirls are involved in this whooping crane disappearance you know perfectly well they are last seen in nebraska didnt make it to canada siwash lake is between nebraska and canada the cowgirls have possession of siwash lake and who else but jellybeans wild cunts could possibly conceive of doing something so diabolical as to tamper with the last flock of some nearly extinct birds how much do you know about it have they murdered those cranes the way they murdered my moo cows	i dont know anything about it
that means topsecret cooper	i heard it
you still need the rope i thought you were one a those spacemen with ice in ya veins	id rather be on the rope and not need it than need it and not have it now step aside old man
do you copy	uh yeah coop im still here
shit do not do that where the fuck are you	im in the second containment area its pitch black in here there must have been a coolant leak man this shit is everywhere i cant see a damn thing
holy shit	justin
time to play spam in the can	dont start with me cooper
okay listen up as you all know by now we have an addition to our crew dr weir this is starck navigation smith pilot justin ships engineer 	you can call him babybear he loves that
cancel our leave and send us out on some bullshit mission	everybody shut up let the man speak
from what	youre convinced the crew could still be alive after seven years
come on skipper i already put my shoes on	youve had plenty eva coop its justins turn stay on station if anything happens
we have a man down	coop where are you
the containment second containment	hold on coop
but justin	ill get him
will it work	it worked for weir prep the tanks
you been out there a long time trying to break my record	id rather spend the next twelve hours outside than another five minutes in this can this ship is bad it watches you
shit smith youre going biblical on me	you know what happened to the tower of babel dont you it fell down
well have to reroute through the port conduit to the apu	what about the accumulator
solid as a rock  hey smith	smith clear that airlock man im coming in
damn dr weir dont scare us like that coffee	what
coffee	no thank you
you werent there i saw it	saw what mr cooper what did you really see because what youre describing is not physically possible
what you saw could have been an optical effect caused by gravitational distortion	i know what i saw and it wasnt a fucking optical effect
is that an offer	it is not
let me breathe let me breathe	youre okay now its over
can you shut it down	i dont know the process dr weir was the expert
im gonna activate the emergency beacon	hurry
what	run
hes a rescue technician peters medical technician dj	trauma
we havent tested the air yet it could be contaminated	no time we need whatevers left in our suits to repair the clark like it or not this is the only oxygen for three billion kilometers
how is he	his vitals are stable but hes unresponsive to stimuli he might wake up in fifteen minutes he might not wake up at all
carbon dioxide poisoning produces hallucinations impaired judgement	goddammit dj it was not a hallucination i saw a man he was on fire and then he disappeared
to conserve our oxygen we should severely restrict our activity anyone who can should get some sleep	i dont need sleep dj i need answers
hell live if we ever make it back	well make it
i i tried to go back for him to save him but i couldnt get to him in time the fire have you ever seen fire in zerogravity its like a liquid it slides over everything it was like a wave breaking over him a wave of fire and then he was gone  i never told anyone until now but this ship knew dj it knows about the goliath it knows about corrick it knows our secrets it knows what were afraid of  and now youre going to tell me its carbon dioxide	no
what is it	ive been listening to the transmission and i think houston made a mistake in the translation
they thought it said liberatis me save me but its not me its tutemet save yourself	its not a distress call its a warning
it sounds like ex infera ex from infera the ablative case of inferi hell	save yourself from hell  what are you saying are you saying that this ship is possessed
dj the clarks gone smith and cooper are dead	what happened
please	oh god dj what do i how do i
please kill	oh god
whats wrong	nothing its nothing
whats happening	a power drain 
whats wrong	you didnt hear it you must have heard it
ive got a pulse hes alive	pressure
90 over 50 and falling 	hes crashing
intubate pure oxygen feed get the nitrogen out of his blood	his peritoneum has ruptured
does he know that	whats on your mind
he doesnt belong on this mission responsible or not he blames himself hes too close to it  and then theres his wife	its been two years since she died hes over it
i want our best people on this wheres miller	the lewis and clark just returned from patrol in the asteroid belt shes docked in bay four
what justin what shows you	it wont stop it goes on and on and on
what does	the dark inside me
its inside and it eats and eats until theres nothing left	the dark inside i dont understand
oh my god oh my god	starck
is zero thats what the singularity does it folds space so that point a and point b coexist in the same space and time after the ship passes through this gateway space returns to normal  its called a gravity drive	how do you know all this
youve reached the first containment seal the engineering decks are on the other side	we still have pressure the radiation counts steady at 7 millirads an hour
ive reached another containment door this things huge	thats the second containment seal beyond that engineering
okay we do it the hard way deck by deck room by room starck deploy the umbilicus i believe youre up for a walk mr justin go get your bonnet on	yes sir
justin finish your sweep	almost done i just gotta check one thing
i dont want to die	youre not going to die not today i want you to do exactly as i say and im gonna get you out of there alright
but i cant i gotta get out of here skipper please	justin i wont let you die
this is weir	dr weir admiral hollis would like to see you as soon as possible
i can understand your desire to redeem your reputation dr weir but it doesnt factor into this	this is not about my reputation this is not about me at all  the event horizon was created for one reason to go faster than light imagine mankind exploring new solar systems colonizing new worlds seven years ago we didnt just lose the ship and the crew we lost the dream  i have to go
since the initial transmission theres been no further contact just the beacon every two minutes	the crew could they still be alive
the ship had life support systems for eighteen months theyre been gone seven years	someone sent that message admiral you have to put me on that ship
i put in for a replacement for you but no one	no no its alright i talked to my ex hell keep denny over christmas and ill get him this summer  goddam it skipper i havent seen him in two months
weve got pressure	clear and open on my mark three two one mark
jesus its huge	ice crystals everywhere this place is a deep freeze
that means they didnt abandon ship	so where are they starck any luck with the bioscan
peters is right no ones here	i dont know this place is really dark i cant see a thing
i can see the hatch	starck you still showing those readings
the blood came from somewhere peters	theres no one here skipper
everythings been shut down conserving power i guess green light on the hull its intact	the science workstation has power ill see if i can find the crew from here
i found one	alive
justin check the containment for radiation leaks peters	hows the client
peters i want you to go through the ships log see if we cant find some answers	i can use the station in medical keep an eye on justin
i can run the image through a series of filters try to clean it up	do it
thats a negative starck	justin
peters we need to know what happened to the crew before it happens to us	ill get back to the log but on the bridge i wont go back back in there
captain miller i just want to say	the clock is running dr weir if youll follow the rest of the crew theyll show you to the gravity tanks
captain miller i appreciate this opportunity	doctor weir my crew is not going on your mission because we want to we were pulled off a well deserved leave to be sent out to the middle of nowhere and no ones even told us why
it was the ships maiden voyage to test the drive the event horizon moved to safe distance using ion thrusters they received the goahead to activate the gravity drive  and the ship vanished from all our scopes no radar contact no enhanced optical no radio contact of any kind they disappeared without a trace  until now	where has it been for the last seven years
what does it say	nsa encryption specialists have deciphered some of the message
thats the engineering containment and theres the main airlock we can dock there	smith use the arm and lock us onto that antennae cluster
dr weir i need you on the bridge	captain i didnt come out here to sit on your bridge i need to be on that ship
once the ship is secured well bring you on board 	that is not acceptable 
youre in the central corridor it connects the personnel areas to engineering	peters and i will search the forward decks justin take engineering no hotdogging not on this one alright
i can see that whatre they for	in an emergency the charges detonate in series destroying the central section and separating the personnel areas from the rest of the ship that way if the gravity drive malfunctions the crew could use the foredecks as a lifeboat
easy peters were okay were okay lets finish the sweep	captain miller the foredecks are just ahead
any survivors	negative
no one	theyre empty dr weir moving forward
it beats dying mister smith	dr weirs right get on board the event horizon ill meet you at the airlock
hold on whats this gravitational distortion	its possible that a burst of gravity waves escaped from the core distorting spacetime they could be what hit the lewis and clark
what could cause them  whats in the core	its complicated
its insane	insane the finest astronauts fought to be posted to this ship it would take the lewis and clark a thousand years to reach our closest star the event horizon could be there in a day
if it worked	if it worked yes
i want this room sealed the second containment is off limits	theres no danger the black hole is contained behind three magnetic fields its under control
you have something dr weir	the date
what about it	the event horizons computer thinks its 2034
its 2041	exactly the ships internal clock is off by seven years
explanation	intense gravitational fields effect the passage of time its possible  black holes make sense on paper its all math you see but as to what really happened  the event horizon has passed beyond our plane of reality and like lazarus returned from the dead
what the hell is that dr weir	i dont know
were a long way from home and were in a bad place lets not make it worse if anyone has any constructive suggestions now is the time	i think i can stabilize the fields around the singularity that should prevent another power drain
is that your expert opinion the only answer weve had out of you is i dont know	justin just tried to kill himself the man is clearly insane
i want to know what caused that noise i want to know why one of my crew tried to throw himself out of the airlock	thermal changes in the hull could have caused the metal to expand and contract very suddenly causing reverberations 
thats bullshit and you know it you built this fucking ship and all ive heard from you is bullshit	what do you want me to say
you said this ship creates a gateway	yes
to what where did this ship go where did you send it	i dont know
where has it been for the past seven years	i dont know
the other place what is that	i dont know  i dont know theres a lot of things going on here that i dont understand truth takes time
were leaving	you cant your orders are specific
to rescue the crew and salvage the ship the crew is dead dr weir this ship killed them and now its killing us	youre insane youve lost your mind
maybe youre right but its still my command and i have leeway to abort when i feel there is an unacceptable threat to my crew and i think there is  starck download all the files from the event horizons computers coop smith finish moving the co2 scrubbers back onto the clark	dont dont do this
what about my ship	we will take the lewis and clark to a safe distance and then launch tac missiles at the event horizon until i am satisfied that she has been destroyed  fuck this ship
you you cant do that	watch me
you cant leave she wont let you	just get your gear back onto the lewis and clark doctor or youll find yourself looking for a ride home
i told you she wont let you leave	son of a bitch
your eyes	i dont need them anymore where were going we wont need eyes to see
what are you talking about	do you know what a singularity is miller does your mind truly fathom what a black hole is  it is nothing absolute and eternal nothing and if god is everything then i have seen the devil  its a liberating experience
weir is dead	then who the fuck are you
what are you	you know
you want me to believe youre the devil well i dont thats bullshit	im not the devil
there is no devil there is no god there is only nothing	youre lying
you cant have them go to hell	nooo
jesus	what is that
heading threethreefour	make your approach vector negative fourteen degrees
we have a lock on the event horizons navigation beacon its in the upper ionosphere were in for some chop	bring us in tight starck get on the horn see if anyones listening
were all on edge smith were a long way out	thats not it that ship was built to go faster than light thats just wrong it goes against everything we know
what are you trying to say if god had intended man to fly he would have given us wings	something like that yeah
i guess were about to find out keep us slow and steady	yes sir
weve got some weather	i noticed starck anybody home
1500 meters were getting too close	where is it
proximity warning 900 800 meters 700 were right on top of it were gonna hit	starck
put it through tacs smith you up for a flyby	love to
captain miller	smith where the hell have you been
do we have enough time for a weld	we dont have time to fart
were losing pressure at 280 liters a second and our oxygen tanks are cracked in three minutes our atmosphere will be gone we are fucking dead	no ones dying on my watch smith what about the reserve tanks
but	you heard me smith peters are you with me
captain miller you copy	im here smith hows the clark
ive found a six inch fracture in the outer hull we should be able to repair it and repressurize its gonna take some time	we dont have time smith in twenty hours we run out of air
you break all the laws of physics you think there wont be a price you already killed the first crew	thats enough
sir	get outside go back to work ill join you shortly
thank you	captain we got a problem
now what	she was right behind me i turn around shes gone she could be anywhere
skipper	what is it smith
smith get out of there	come again skipper
get off the clark now and wait for me at the airlock	no no we just got her back together
where is it where is it	smith smith fuck
were past the outer marker we can engage the ion drive whenever youre ready	justin
starck why arent you on the bridge	i just finished drying
crossing the horizon optimum approach angle is fourteen degrees	come around to threethreefour
everybody okay	were all here
it tastes bad	but you can breathe it
the antennae arrays completely fried weve got no radio no laser no highgain no ones going to be coming to help us	how much ohtwo do we have
oxygen is not the problem	carbon dioxide
its building up with every breath we take and the co2 filters on the event horizon are shot	we can take the filters from the clark
i thought of that with the filters from the clark weve got enough breathable air for twenty hours after that wed better be on our way home	what about the life readings you picked up
the event horizon sensors show the same thing bioreadings of indeterminate origin right before that wave hit the clark there was some kind of surge right off the scale but now its back to its previous levels	whats causing the readings
i dont know but whatever it is its not the crew	so where is the rest of the crew weve been over every inch of this ship and all weve found is blood dr weir any suggestions
whats the point ill just get the same thing	not acceptable i want to know whats causing those readings if the crew is dead i want the bodies i want the crew found
i can reconfigure the scan for c12 amylase proteins	do it dr weir
maybe one of the original crew	no it was someone else
who	dr weir you were right there you must have heard something seen something
miller	what is it starck
go ahead	there was a another surge in the bio readings right before you you saw what you saw we picked up a similar readings right before the clarke was damaged what if there were a connection between the two the gravity waves the hallucination all part of an defensive reaction like an immune system
its not bullshit its the only conclusion the data supports	starck do you know how crazy that sounds its impossible
if you knew it was impossible then whyd you waste my time	i thought you wanted an answer and thats the only one i have
what i want is to survive the next ten hours	nine hours and twentytwo minutes
miller come in	whats going on in there starck
what	hes awake hes in the airlock hes not wearing a suit
im on my way starck	you better hurry hes engaged the override we cant open the inner door
tuck yourself into a crouched position shut your eyes as tight as you can	five seconds
ill do it 	no ill be right back
were armed this fuckers ready to blow	repeat were armed
weir	hes dead
first time in a grav couch	yes
dont worry about it hes hard but hes fair youre lucky to be shipping out with him hes one of the few captains in the service with experience in the outer reach	hes been past mars
heres another one theyre all over the place	theyre explosive charges
dr weir whats this the door to	youre at the bridge ms peters you still havent seen any crew
yes we can see some kind of mist what is that	blood looks like arterial spray
can you see a body	theres no one here
no i saw nothing	i did
about an hour ago in medical i saw my son he was lying on one of the examination tables and his legs were 	isnt it possible that you were traumatized by finding the body on the bridge
theres no one in the corridor but us	not according to the computer
hes engaged the override	can you shut it down
yes yes justin we heard it	keep him talking
almost got it	come on babybear open this door
we have to do something oh god	skipper justin just activated the door its on a thirty second delay
you got any coffee	its cold
hey	say this paper represents spacetime and you want to get from point a here  to point b here  now whats the shortest distance between two points
jesus that is one big ugly fat fucker	shes not ugly
foredecks crew quarters bridge medical and science labs hydroponics what have you that central section connects the forward decks to the engineering containment area can we move in closer	shit doc any closer and were gonna need a rubber
what	it still has air and reserve power we can activate gravity and life support
30 hours to neptune orbit	all boards are green everythings five by five
you cant do that	the law of relativity prohibits faster thanlight travel
this is us aerospace command vessel lewis and clark hailing event horizon event horizon do you read this is the lewis and clark hailing 	matching speed now range to target ten thousand meters and closing skipper i got a bad feeling about this
the scope is lit its right in front of us	1000 meters
range 500 meters and holding turbulence is dropping off	picking up magnetic interference
what happened to his eyes	explosive decompression
miller do you read me peters 	get them back 
what if the air has gone bad we cant wear these suits forever	i dont think this is a good idea we dont even know what happened on that ship
relativity yes we cant break the law of relativity but we can go around it the ship doesnt really move faster than the speed of light it creates a dimensional gateway that allows the ship to instantaneously jump from one point in the universe to another light years away	how
a straight line	wrong the shortest distance between two points
the reactors still hot weve got several small radiation sources leaks probably nothing serious	do they have pressure
could it be the crew if they were in suspended animation wouldnt that effect the scan	if they were in stasis id get a location but these readings theyre all over the ship it doesnt make any sense
what is it	ships log
why dr weir i think youre in love	hmmm claire used to tell me i loved the event horizon more than i loved her i told her that wasnt true i just knew the event horizon better thats all
it must be hard being so far away from her	yes i miss her she died two years now
maybe a power interruption crashed the system	no theres no evidence of a surge or spike of any kind its as if time just stopped for seven years
what are you doing	it wants me i have to go
what is it	the forward airlock
justin said something about the dark inside me what did he mean	it means nothing
i dont think shes real big on hate	you wouldnt say that if you could see me
such a sad face you know sometimes being different isnt a bad thing	trust me this aint one of those times
howd you know it was me	im blind not deaf wanna come in
were going to have to work on your touch	i like the sound of that
you dont know what its like out there walking around like some kind of circus freak people staring whispering 	i wouldnt know anything about that
i mean	tell me when you grew up in brooklyn how many astronauts did you know  you went your own way then you didnt listen to people so why start now
way to not overthink it  so when do we leave	ill schedule the launch call me in the morning to talk about resources and crew
i can handle the ship i can even handle mr blonde ambition but i dont know if i should be flying or playing vegas in these suits who the hell came up with them	victor did
we can monitor the clouds approach and observe the tests from here	is it safe
i can only stay for one drink ben ive got to meet with victor	wouldnt want to keep vic waiting
we need to give you a physical so we know what got zapped	well why didnt you say so you want me to lift some weights or something
you look like an eighties rock band	the suit will stretch you should try it 
he didnt	oh he did
he didnt mean it you know johnny hes always been a hothead 	its not him its them  i cant live like this
just give reed a little more time you know how he works  analyzing every little step before he takes one 	its easy for you to be patient
where is reed	victor mustve taken him
what are you doing here	im worried about you
about me how sweet	come on let me buy you something to eat looks like you could use the company
ben come in	what is this wheres reed
what do you want vic	to help you ive run every test known to man and they all yield the same result the machine is ready
reed said itd be weeks till 	he also said wed avoid that storm in space and we know how that turned out
ill be watching over you	just get back soon or i start looking for a new groom
soon as im back im gonna trade that in for a bigger rock	i dont care about rocks i care about you  you bring him back in one piece or you can forget being best man
deb its me i need you to step out front	out front you home baby i got a surprise for you
